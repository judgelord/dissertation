The Obama administration's Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued the <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/07/16/2015-17032/affirmatively-furthering-fair-housing"">Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) Rule</a> in July 2015, fulfilling the unmet mandate of the Fair Housing Act. The rule requires any community receiving block-grant funding from HUD to complete a comprehensive Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH) to analyze its housing stock and come up with a plan for addressing patterns of segregation and discrimination. 
<br><br>
On January 5, 2018, HUD Secretary Ben Carson issued a <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/01/05/2018-00106/affirmatively-furthering-fair-housing-extension-of-deadline-for-submission-of-assessment-of-fair"">notice</a> stating that HUD would immediately stop reviewing plans that had been submitted but not yet accepted, and that participating jurisdictions now had until October 31, 2020 to submit their assessments. (Previously, municipalities were implementing the rule in a rolling fashion, largely based on where they were in their local planning cycles.) On May 8, 2018, the National Fair Housing Alliance <a href=""http://nationalfairhousing.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Filed-complaint-1.pdf"">sued</a> HUD for illegally suspending the AFFH Rule, which New York State <a href=""https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-new-york-state-join-lawsuit-against-federal-government-failing-enforce"">joined</a> on May 14, 2018.

The rule was supposed to provide the opportunity for alternative legal recourse for harmed consumers against these financial companies, most importantly class action lawsuits. Financial companies and the Treasury Department <a href = ""http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-treasury-arbitration-20171023-story.html"">claimed</a> that the CFPB's own analysis demonstrated the rule's ineffectiveness and that the rule primarily benefitted trial lawyers. Consumer advocates and congressional Democrats supported the rule. 
<br><br>
The day after the final rule was published, <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/member/keith-rothfus/R000598"">Rep. Keith Rothfus (R-PA)</a> introduced a joint resolution of disapproval to nullify the rule under the <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-powerful-is-the-congressional-review-act/"">Congressional Review Act</a>. Five days later, the resolution <a href = ""http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll412.xml"">passed the House</a>, with votes along party lines.

The DoEd undertook ""borrower defense"" rulemaking following a series of high-profile closures of several for-profit college groups, notably <a href = ""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/education/corinthian-colleges-shuts-down-ending-classes-16-000-overnight-n348741"">Corinthian Colleges</a>, which had left the DoEd in charge of thousands of borrower defense claims. The DoEd cited this backlog in a <a href = ""https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-protecting-students-abusive-career-colleges""> June 2015 press release</a> announcing it would develop new regulations to facilitate borrower defense claims processing. The DoEd's final rule streamlined the claims process, and greatly expanded the rights of students seeking debt relief under claims of fraud. 
<br><br>
On May 24, 2017, just over one month before the Borrower Defense Rule was set to come into effect, a California-based trade association representing mostly for-profit schools <a href = ""https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/files/california_for-profits_borrowerdefense.pdf"">filed suit</a> alleging the new rules unfairly expanded borrower defense rights, and the Trump administration responded by delaying the rules pending resolution of the litigation.

On September 12, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled in favor of the state attorneys generals, writing in an <a href=""https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2017cv1330-87"">opinion</a> that the delays were ""arbitrary and capricious"" and ""procedurally invalid."" <span class=""new"">On October 16, 2018, the rule finally went into effect, as Judge Moss <a href=""https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/media/CAPPS%20order.pdf"">ruled</a> for its immediate implementation. However, the legal fights regarding this rule are likely to continue.

The new proposed rule provides debt relief based on income, with those earning less than 50 percent of their peers receiving full loan forgiveness. On March 17, 2018, four students defrauded by Corinthian Colleges <a href=""https://predatorystudentlending.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Calvillo-Manriquez-First-Amended-Compl-w-Exhibits.pdf"">amended</a> their <a href=""https://predatorystudentlending.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Calvillo-Manriquez-v.-DeVos-Complaint.pdf"">class action lawsuit</a>, and filed a <a href=""https://predatorystudentlending.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PI-redacted_Redacted.pdf"">motion for preliminary injunction</a> against Secretary DeVos, claiming that the Average Earnings Rule violated the <a href=""https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/USCODE-2010-title5/USCODE-2010-title5-partI-chap5-subchapII-sec552a"">Privacy Act</a> by collecting income data from the Social Security Administration without authorization.

<br><br>
Thirteen states sued to block the rule, and a judge in the U.S. District Court for North Dakota issued a <a href=""https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/pdfs/w/o/t/t/a/WOTUSNorthDakota.pdf"">preliminary injunction</a> in August 2015, hours before the rule was to take effect.

In response, the National Association of Manufacturers appealed to Supreme Court, arguing that the Sixth Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction. 
<br><br>
On January 22, 2018, the Supreme Court issued a <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-299_8nk0.pdf"">unanimous ruling</a> that lawsuits to challenge the WOTUS rule must be filed in federal district courts rather than federal courts of appeals, voiding the Sixth Circuit's claim of jurisdiction, and throwing into doubt the future of its nationwide stay.

This action is part of the second step in a two-step process directed by <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/03/03/2017-04353/restoring-the-rule-of-law-federalism-and-economic-growth-by-reviewing-the-waters-of-the-united"">Executive Order 13778</a>, which calls for a substantive reevaluation and revision of the ""Waters of the United States"" rule.

<br><br>
The Clean Water Act makes it unlawful to pollute WOTUS without a permit. The proposed rule narrows the definition of WOTUS, reducing the number of federally protected bodies of water. It identifies six categories of water that would be considered WOTUS: traditional navigable waters, tributaries, certain ditches, certain lakes and ponds, impoundments, and adjacent wetlands that physically touch other jurisdictional waters. 
<br><br>
Wetlands that are separated from tributaries by land, dikes or other features would not be included in this definition. Ephemeral waters that only flow after rain events would also be excluded from protection. According to a <a href=""https://www.eenews.net/assets/2018/12/11/document_gw_05.pdf"">slideshow</a> prepared by EPA and the army and obtained by <a href=""https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060109323"">E&E</a> news under the Freedom of Information Act, this would exclude at least 18 percent of streams and 51 percent of wetlands nationwide from federal protection.  
<br><br>
This rule interprets ""navigable waters"" in a manner largely consistent with Justice Scalia's <a href=""https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/547/04-1034/opinion.pdf"">opinion</a> in <a href=""https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/547/04-1034/index.pdf"">Rapanos v.

Due to concerns that STLDI, which is exempt from certain ACA requirements, was being sold as a type of primary coverage, the Obama administration promulgated <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/10/31/2016-26162/excepted-benefits-lifetime-and-annual-limits-and-short-term-limited-duration-insurance"">regulations</a> in October 2016 stipulating that STLDI coverage must be less than three months in duration (previously, STLDI coverage could last up to one year).

Previously, they were required to provide the names and addresses of their donors on the <a href=""https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f990ezb.pdf""> Schedule B form </a>, the ""Schedule of Contributors."" However, these organizations must continue to retain this information in their records and make it available upon request, if required. 
<br><br>
This rule does not change the annual returns information that is available to the public, since private taxpayer information has historically not been disclosed to the public. Nor does the rule change anything in respect to the reporting of contribution information or the administration of the tax code. The rule is expected to reduce the compliance costs concerned with reporting, on both private and government ends, and reduce the risks associated with sensitive donor information. However, while it may protect free speech and privacy, it also runs the risk of fostering political activity in the non-profit space.

Previously,interagency policies had established compensatory mitigation policies. For example, both the 1995 interagency policy on the establishment and operation of wetland mitigation banks (<a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/60-FR-58605"">60 FR 58605</a>, November 28, 1995) and the 2000 interagency policy on the use of in-lieu fee arrangements (<a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/65-FR-66914"">65 FR 66914</a>, November 7, 2000), establish compensatory mitigation policies, but are specific to wetland mitigation.

The Endangered Species Act Compensatory Mitigation Policy (CMP) was the first comprehensive treatment of compensatory mitigation to be issued by the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service).

Further, the proposal would eliminate specific examples of when consultation is required, and the Services would only consider alterations impacting critical habitat ""as a whole."" The rule also eliminates references to ""indirect effects"" and effects of ""interrelated and interdependent"" actions of discretionary actions. It would also ""avoid inclusion of activities whose occurrences would be considered speculative."" 
<br><br>

Some HOS rules in brief: following 10 or more consecutive hours off-duty, drivers are limited to 11 hours of driving within a 14-hour window. Drivers who use ""sleeper berths""--a seat that can be reclined to form a bed--may divide the minimum 10 hours of off-duty into two periods: they must take at least 8 consecutive hours of the minimum 10-hour off-duty period in the sleeper berth. The rules also prohibit driving if more than 8 hours have passed since the end of the driver's last off-duty or sleeper-berth period that lasted at least 30 minutes.

","The <a href=""https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&title=16&year=mostrecent&section=1531&type=usc&link-type=html"">Endangered Species Act</a> (ESA) requires the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service (collectively referred to as the ""Services"")  to determine whether a species <a href=""https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2016-title16/html/USCODE-2016-title16-chap35-sec1533.htm"">qualifies to go on the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants</a> and designate critical habitat. The ESA defines a threatened species as one that is ""likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or significant part of its range. 
<br><br>
""The proposed rule makes four major changes. First, the proposal would remove the prohibition on the Services describing economic factors when listing, delisting, or reclassifying species as threatened or endangered. Second, the new rule defines ""foreseeable future"" as ""only so far into the future as the Services can reasonably determine that the conditions potentially posing a danger of extinction in the foreseeable future are probable,"" and would apply on a species-by-species basis. Third, the proposal would incorporate measures for ensuring that evaluations of potential species delistings under the ESA receive similar time and attention as evaluations of potential species listings. Finally, the rule proposes to return to pre-Obama era standards for designating critical habitats. Designation of critical habitat should be limited to the areas occupied by the species at the time of listing, with unoccupied areas considered for designation as critical habitat ""only upon a determination that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species."" Unoccupied areas will be considered only if an area limited to the occupied area ""would be inadequate"" or ""less efficient."""

In particular, the EPA broadly solicited comments on issued associated with ""delayed repair,"" the requirement that repair or replacement of a leaking fugitive emissions component be completed during the next scheduled shutdown if at the time of damage it was infeasible or unsafe to repair. But seemingly contradictory language in the final rule regarding unscheduled and emergency events caused confusion: the rule's text stated that the only unscheduled and emergency events subject to the delayed repair requirement were those related to ""vent blowdown,"" while the preamble of the rule seemed to imply that other unscheduled or emergency events would also trigger the delayed repair requirement.

The FDA also has the authority to resolve discrepancies between ""intended"" and ""actual"" uses in making a regulatory determination, depending on the manufacturer's knowledge of off-label uses. This latter authority, known as the ""knowledge provision,"" is rarely exercised. On September 25, 2015, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <a href = ""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/09/25/2015-24313/clarification-of-when-products-made-or-derived-from-tobacco-are-regulated-as-drugs-devices-or"">proposed</a> a rule to clarify ambiguity concerning when a tobacco product qualifies as a drug and device, and could therefore be regulated as a medical product under the <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/LawsEnforcedbyFDA/FederalFoodDrugandCosmeticActFDCAct/default.htm"">Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act</a>. The FDA proposed to do this in several ways, including modifying the basis for determining a product's ""intended uses.""

Under the <a href=""https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf"">Fair Labor Standards Act</a>, an employer of tipped employees can satisfy its obligation to pay those employees the federal minimum wage by paying a lower direct cash wage and counting a limited amount of the tips received by its employees as a partial credit (known as a ""tip credit""). A <a href=""https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-88/pdf/STATUTE-88-Pg55.pdf"">1974 statute</a> stipulates that employers can only take a tip credit if its tipped employees retained all tips. However, the statute does not preclude an employer that takes a tip credit from implementing a tip pool, but requires that only employees who ""customarily and regularly receive tips"" can participate in the pool. In 2011, the Department of Labor (DoL) <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/04/05/2011-6749/updating-regulations-issued-under-the-fair-labor-standards-act"">updated</a> its regulations to clarify that tipped employees must retain all tips, regardless of whether the employer takes a tip credit. On December 5, 2017, the DoL <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/05/2017-25802/tip-regulations-under-the-fair-labor-standards-act-flsa"">proposed</a> to expand tip sharing to include employees who do not regularly receive tips, such as restaurant cooks and dishwashers. 
<br><br>
While the proposed rule ostensibly is meant to close the pay disparity between tipped servers and hourly back-of-the-house employees, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp/2017/12/07/the-trump-administration-proposes-allow-tip-pooling-in-restaurants-critics-call-it-stealing-workers-wages/?utm_term=.58791a3c2f7c"">critics</a> claim that the proposed rule goes too far by allowing employers to control all tips and distribute them to anyone, including salaried workers or the owners themselves.

Upon <a href=""https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-title-ix-201709.pdf"">rescinding</a> two Obama-era Title IX guidelines on September 22, 2017, Education Secretary Betsy Devos had promised that she would introduce new Title IX regulations. On January 25, 2018, three victims' and women's rights groups <a href=""http://www.survjustice.org/uploads/9/2/9/6/92967220/survjustice_v_devos.pdf"">filed</a> suit against the the Department of Education (DoEd) for withdrawing the Obama-era guidance. Subsequently, on November 16, 2018, DoEd promulgated Title IX regulations, which were then <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/11/29/2018-25314/nondiscrimination-on-the-basis-of-sex-in-education-programs-or-activities-receiving-federal"">published</a> in the Federal Register for notice and comment on November 29, 2018. 
<br><br>
Citing Supreme Court precedent, the new regulations narrow the definition of sexual harassment in light of clarity, defining it as ""unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so  severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school's education program or activity."" Obama-era guidelines define it as  ""unwelcome conduct of sexual nature."" The new regulations also narrow the circumstances when schools are obligated to respond to an incident to when the school has ""actual knowledge"" of sexual harassment. This ""actual knowledge"" clause requires the accuser to officially report to an individual who has authority to institute corrective measures. Additionally, the incident must have taken place within the school's 'own programs or activities.'
<br><br>
The proposed regulations would hold schools responsible under Title IX only when their response to sexual harassment complaints is ""clearly unreasonable in light of known circumstances."" Nonetheless, they would be required to investigate and respond meaningfully to every formal complaint and maintain supportive measures for victims regardless of whether a complaint was filed officially or not. 
<br><br>
Finally, regarding the investigation of incidents, the regulations lays out certain due process protections. Investigations would be based on a presumption of innocence for the accused, and schools would be allowed to choose the evidentiary standard between a ""preponderance of evidence"" or ""clear and convincing evidence"" in holding accused students responsible. Institutions of higher education will be expected to conduct live hearings, and cross-examination would be allowed by advisers and attorneys. 'Rape shield protections' would be extended to victims, preventing the examiners from inquiring about the victims' sexual history. Final determinations would have to be made by third-party individuals not conducting the investigation

","<a href=""https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/understanding-the-affordable-care-acts-state-innovation-1332-waivers"">""Section 1332 waivers""</a> allow states to modify how they implement key elements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as long as the state's alternative plan provided coverage that was at least as comprehensive and affordable, covered at least as many people, and did not increase the federal deficit. On October 24, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Treasury (""the Departments"") issued <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/10/24/2018-23182/state-relief-and-empowerment-waivers"">guidance</a> that modifies the criteria the agencies use to evaluate section 1332 waivers, most importantly by reinterpreting these statutory ""guardrails.""
<br><br>
Under the new guidance, the Departments indicate that they will evaluate compliance with the comprehensiveness and affordability guardrails based on what types of plans consumers have access to under the waiver, whereas the Obama Administration interpreted these requirements as applying to the coverage consumers actually obtained under the waiver. The Departments also say that waivers will meet these two guardrails as long as the number of people for whom coverage becomes more affordable or comprehensive exceeds the number for whom coverage becomes less affordable or comprehensive, whereas the Obama Administration required that waivers not adversely affect certain specified groups, including low-income people and people with greater health care needs. 
<br><br>
The new guidance also broadens the definition of insurance coverage used in evaluating the coverage guardrail to encompass short-term health plans (see Reg Tracker entry ""Definition of Short-Term Limited-Duration Insurance"") and association health plans, which are not subject to the same requirements as ACA-compliant individual market plans. Short-term health plans may refuse to cover people with pre-existing conditions and charge them higher premiums and are not required to cover the ACA's list of ""essential"" benefits, ranging from hospital care and prescription drugs to mental health and substance abuse services, nor cap enrollee's annual out-of-pocket costs.
<br><br>
The ultimate consequences of the new guidance will depend on the proposals states submit. However, the new guidance will permit approval of waivers that could not have been approved under prior guidance. This likely includes waivers that would shift subsidies to higher-income enrollees and away from lower-income enrollees, as well as waivers that would increase costs for sicker people while reduce them for a larger number of healthier people. This also includes waivers that would redirect subsidy dollars to short-term health plans. Expanding subsidies in this way would benefit people in short-term plans, but would generally reduce subsidies and increase premiums for the sicker population that purchase coverage in the ACA-compliant market. There is concern that some such waivers could threaten the continued existence of the ACA-compliant market. <br><br>  <em class=""new"">On May 3, 2019, the Departments issued a <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/05/03/2019-09121/request-for-information-regarding-state-relief-and-empowerment-waivers"">request</a> for information to solicit public comment on ideas for waiver concepts that states could consider in developing their own 1332 waiver plans.

This influences the responsibility and liability that these joint-employers hold towards the employees under labor practices and worker protection laws. Examples of cases where these standards hold relevance are staffing agencies and subcontractors that contract workers to other firms and franchisor-franchisee relationships. These standards have significant consequences for businesses, unions and employees.
<br><br>
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has determined the standards applicable for a joint-employer status through various decisions passed over time. Due to decisions taken in 1984, the joint-employer status definition was narrowed, such that indirect control was typically insufficient to determine that one company was the joint employer of another business' workers. This definition was overturned with NLRB's <a href=""https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-issues-decision-browning-ferris-industries"">Browning-Ferris Industries</a> (BFI) decision in August 2015, which expanded the joint-employer status to also include those employers that exercised indirect control over an employee's terms of employment to be considered as 'joint-employers'.  The BFI decision was then overruled by NLRB's <a href=""https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-overrules-browning-ferris-industries-and-reinstates-prior-joint"">Hy-Brand decision</a> in December 2017, which returned to the pre-BFI narrow joint-employer standards. This Hy-Brand decision was then <a href=""https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-vacates-hy-brand-decision"">vacated</a> in February 2018, reinstating the BFI standard.
<br><br>
On September 14, 2018, NLRB promulgated a <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/09/14/2018-19930/the-standard-for-determining-joint-employer-status"">notice of proposed rulemaking</a> establishing the joint-employer standards. This rule narrows the standards, returning them back to pre-BFI standards. Under this proposal, an employer must ""possess and actually exercise direct and immediate control over the terms and conditions of employment"" to be considered a 'joint-employer'. This will make it easier for companies to evade the joint-employer status. The comment period, originally open for 60 days, was extended by a month until December 13, 2018 in a <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/11/05/2018-24134/the-standard-for-determining-joint-employer-status"">rule</a> published on November 5, 2018.

This <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2015/09/01/435491783/fight-to-save-the-sage-grouse-finds-friends-in-all-corners-of-the-west"">spurred various interest groups</a> (including government agencies, energy producers, and environmental groups) to work together and enact a series protections that were less stringent than what they would've been under the ESA, but would be effective enough so that the bird would be kept off the endangered species list. The efforts were largely successful: the Department of the Interior <a href=""https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/historic-conservation-campaign-protects-greater-sage-grouse"">announced</a> in 2015 that threats to the bird had been significantly reduced, and that the population had rebounded; the sage grouse would not be put on the endangered species list.

These rules set emission limits at a level that would be difficult to reach without carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. 
<br><br>
The NSPS was subsequently challenged in <a href=""http://wordpress2.ei.columbia.edu/climate-change-litigation/case/north-dakota-v-epa/"">North Dakota v. EPA </a>(2015). A key issue was whether partial CCS is an adequately demonstrated technology for reducing GHG emissions from coal-fired power plants.

In the 2015 case <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/14-46"">Michigan v.

If adopted, ""co-benefits""--positive health effects that come from reducing pollutants other than those being targeted--would be excluded from the cost-benefit analysis. For instance, EPA's 2015 <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-11/documents/matsriafinal.pdf"">Risk Impact Analysis</a> estimated that reducing mercury emissions, calculated only for children exposed to recreationally caught freshwater fish, would translate to between $4 to $6 million annually in public health benefits. But co-benefits like the reduction in nitrogen oxide that would accompany cuts to mercury pollution would prevent as many as 11,000 annual premature deaths, and save between $37 billion to $90 billion in annual health costs. Including co-benefits would mean that the benefits exceed the $7.4 to $9.6 billion annual cost, but excluding them would mean that the costs of MATS greatly exceed its benefits. The shift could set a precedent for future public health rules and make it much more difficult to justify environmental regulations in many cases.

The rule expands the number of individuals who are potentially eligible for this FEDVIP. This final rule is considered an E.O. 13771 deregulatory action and is effective June 7, 2019. This rule is a deregulatory action because it offers more dental coverage options and new vision coverage in FEDVIP for TRICARE-eligible individuals."

A “true minor source” is a source that emits NSR pollutants in amounts less than its major source thresholds, but equal to or greater than the minor NSR thresholds. On July 15, 2019, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/07/15/2019-14885/amendments-to-federal-implementation-plan-for-managing-air-emissions-from-true-minor-sources-in"">proposed</a> to amend the Federal NSR program in Indian Country and the <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/air-quality-implementation-plans/basic-information-about-air-quality-fips"">Federal Implementation Plan</a> (FIP) for true minor sources in Indian Country for Oil and Natural Gas Production (National O&NG FIP). 
Currently, sources complying with the National O&NG FIP must submit a Part 1 Form, containing specified information, at least 30 days prior to beginning construction. Additionally, sources must also fulfil requirements concerning potential impacts to protected sources, which include an assessment of potential impacts requiring approval by EPA. This must occur prior to the Part 1 form submission, which might cause delays in the process. The proposed rule amends these requirements, allowing for concurrent submission of these requirements, rather than a sequential one. EPA seeks to streamline the pre-construction process through this rule and it believes that this action will “ not have potential disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority, low-income, or indigenous populations.” Comments for this proposed rule must be received on or before September 13, 2019.

Previously, immigration officers could not apply expedited removal to undocumented immigrants encountered anywhere in the United States--only those encountered within 100 miles of a land border--provided the other conditions for expedited removal were satisfied. The Secretary of Homeland Security has exercised his discretion under the <a href=""https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2017-title8/html/USCODE-2017-title8-chap12-subchapII-partIV-sec1225.htm"">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> (INA) to permit the use of expedited removal, and the designation in this Notice (the New Designation) harmonizes the authorization for undocumented immigrants arriving by land with the existing authorization for undocumented immigrants arriving by sea.
This notice is immediately effective in keeping with the practice followed in announcing the previous designations and consistent with implementing regulations at <a href=""https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2019-title8-vol1/xml/CFR-2019-title8-vol1-sec235-3.xml"">8 CFR 235.3</a>(b)(1)(ii), this designation is effective without prior notice and comment or a delayed effective date.

ADS-B Out is a surveillance technology that helps transmit information about an aircraft’s altitude, speed, and location to ground stations and other equipped aircraft. On October 7, 2007, the FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to mandate ADS-B Out. This rulemaking provides an exception to ADS-B requirements, removing the transmission requirement for sensitive operations conducted by Federal, State and local government entities in matters of national defense, homeland security, intelligence and law enforcement. The changes provide relief to those Federal, State and local government agencies that operate aircraft equipped with ADS-B Out but need the ability to terminate the transmission signal when conducting sensitive national defense, homeland security, intelligence and law enforcement missions that could be compromised by transmitting real time identification and positional flight information over ADS-B Out. This rulemaking also allows the FAA to except certain aircraft from operating a transponder or transmitting ADS-B Out, when doing so would jeopardize Air Traffic Control functions. This interim final rule is expected to be an E.O. 13771 deregulatory action."
