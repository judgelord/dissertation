Please See Attached.,Office Of Alaska State Senator John Coghill,Submitted Electronically Via Erulemaking Portal,1,1,John Coghill,5,NA,Elected,National Endangered Species Act Reform Coalition,Private,NA,Alaska Senate District B,"The Words “Including But Not Limited To,” Is Uncertain And Provides Too Much Leeway To The Services. “Included But Not Limited To” Should Be Eliminated.","The Only Suggestion I Have Is That The Word “Probable” Be Replaced With “Clear And Convincing.” In Fact: Any Time The Word “Probable” Appears Throughout Section 424.11, It Should Be Replaced With “Clear And Convincing.” The Evidence Threshold Should Be Higher.",When A Critical Habitat Designation Limited To Geographical Areas Occupied Would: A. (1) Be Inadequate To Ensure Conservation Of The Species; Or B. (2) Result In Less-Efficient Conversation For The Species. 2. I Respectfully Request That The “Or” Be Changed To “And.” In Other Words: Both Situations Need To Be Apparent For Unoccupied Areas To Be Considered Critical Habitats,NA,-2,NA,1,1,NA,"Comment: Several Commenters Stated That The Phrase “Including But Not Limited To” In The Definition Of Physical Or Biological Features Is Too Vague Or Broad And Should Be Removed From The Definition. Response: In Defining Physical And Biological Features And Including This Particular Phrase, We Provided A Non-Exhaustive List Of Examples Of Types Of Features And Conditions That We Have Found To Be Essential To Certain Species Based On Experience Over Many Years Of Designating Critical Habitat For A Wide Variety Of Species. The Determination Of Specific Features Essential To The Conservation Of A Particular Species Will Be Based On The Best Scientific Data Available And Explained In The Proposal To Designate Critical Habitat For That Species, Which Will Be Available For Public Comment And Peer Review.;Some Commenters Stated That The Word “Probable” Implies That The Services Will Rely On Too Low Of An Evidence Threshold And That The Word “Probable” Should Be Replaced With “Clear And Convincing.” Response: For Maximum Clarity And Consistency With The Statutory Language, This Final Rule Uses “Likely” In Place Of “Probable” In The Relevant Sentence Of The Provision Describing The “Foreseeable Future.” We Are Making This Change To Avoid Any Unintended Confusion. We Further Clarify That “Likely,” In Turn, Means “More Likely Than Not.” This Interpretation Is Supported By Case Law (E.g., Alaska Oil And Gas Association V. Pritzker, 840 F.3d 671, 684 (9th Cir. 2016); Trout Unlimited V. Lohn, 645 F. Supp. 2d 929, 944 (D. Or. 2007); Wwp V. Fws, 535 F.supp.2d 1173, 1184 & N.3 (D. Idaho 2007). Our Foreseeable Future Framework Does Not Depart From The Standards Expressed In The 2009 M-Opinion That Forms The Basis For The Framework (M-37021, January 16, 2009); Rather, It Is Fully Consistent With That Opinion. Our Replacement Of The Term “Probable” With “Likely” Within The Foreseeable Future Framework Should Also Eliminate Concerns That The Services Are Impermissibly Raising The Bar For Listing Species As Threatened To Something Beyond A Threshold Of “Likely” Or Allowing That Classification Determinations Could Be Based On Anything Other Than The “Best Scientific And Commercial Data” Standard. We Must Rely On The “Best Scientific And Commercial Data,” Available, But That Data May Or May Not Indicate Whether Something Is Likely. To Determine An Event Is Likely, We Must Be Able To Determine That It Is More Likely To Occur Than Not After Taking The “Best Scientific And Commercial Data” Into Account. We Will Continue To Apply The Best Available Scientific And Commercial Data In Making Our Listing Determinations As Required Under The Act.;Comment: The Services Should Require That Both (1) Occupied Areas Are Insufficient And (2) Designation Of Occupied Areas Would Result In Less-Efficient Conservation. Response: As Explained Above, In Response To Comments That The “Efficient Conservation” Concept Was Vague, We Have Removed The Provisions Regarding “Efficient Conservation.” Thus, Unoccupied Areas Can Be Considered For Potential Designation Only If Limiting The Designation To Occupied Areas Would Be Inadequate To Ensure Recovery.",Several Commenters,Our Replacement Of The Term,Removed The Provisions,NA,NA,Fws,Https://Ssc.wisc.edu/~Judgelord/Comment_text/Fws/Fws-Hq-Es-2018-0006-0769/Fws-Hq-Es-2018-0006-0769-1.Txt,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Fws-Hq-Es,2018-08-22,Trump,1,5,FALSE,1,FALSE,FALSE,0,76,4.197368421052632,NA,0.2222222222222221,TRUE,0.2222222222222221,0,FALSE,TRUE,NA,288,11-100,0,Supports Rule,Supports Rule,National Endangered Species Act Reform Coalition,Fws,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,No Campaign,NA

Bsee-2017-0008,Https://Www.regulations.gov/Docket/Bsee-2017-0008,Bsee-2017-0008-0473,NA,Https://Www.regulations.gov/Comment/Bsee-2017-0008-0473,"January 25, 2018 Dear Secretary Zinke, I Am Writing To Express Strong Opposition To The Bureau Of Safety And Environmental Enforcement's (Bsee) Proposed Revisions To The Production Safety Systems Rule. I Am Deeply Concerned That Bsee's Recent Proposals Will Significantly Weaken Critical Safety Regulations That Were Adopted In The Wake Of The Deepwater Horizon Tragedy And Urge You To Reject This Ill-Advised Recommendation. I Would Also Note That These Regulations Might Have Prevented The Deepwater Horizon Spill In The First Place. In 2016, Bsee Finalized The Production Safety Systems Rule, Providing The First Updates To Drilling Regulations Since 1988. Specifically, The Rule Updated Guidelines Regulating Acceptable Drilling Pressures At New Drilling Sites, In Order To Prevent Surges And Potential Blowouts Similar To What Occurred In The Deepwater Horizon Spill. The Rule Also Imposed New Requirements For Emergency Shutdown Systems And Strengthened Bsee Rulemaking Authority, Permitting The Agency To Implement New Industry Standards Into Existing Regulations. As You Are Undoubtedly Aware, In 2016 Bsee Adopted These Regulations Over The Course Of Several Years And After Significant Input And Engagement With The Public, Federal Policy Makers, And Industry Stakeholders In Order To Enhance The Safety Of Offshore Oil And Gas Drilling. Now, Less Than Two Years After Implementation, Bsee Has Suggested Severely Curtailing These Regulations Citing ""Potentially Unduly Burdensome Requirements"" On Oil And Gas Operators. Some Of The Most Noteworthy And Egregious Provisions Of The Proposal Include: Removing The Federal Government's Authority To Regulate Safe Maximum Or Minimum Drilling Pressures At New Drill Sites. No Longer Requiring Independent, Third Party Auditors To Certify That Safety And Pollution Prevention Equipment Works Under Extreme Conditions. Limiting Bsee's Regulatory Oversight By Allowing Oil And Gas Companies To Adopt Favorable Industry Standards For Drilling Methods. It Is Not Only Extremely Premature To Back Off Of These Newly-Implemented Safety Regulations, But It Could Also Be Catastrophic To Florida's Pristine Beaches And Coastal Economies. In Fact, According To Miyoko Sakishima, Director Of The Oceans Program At The Center For Biological Diversity, Bsee's Proposal ""Will Put Our Coasts And Wildlife At Risk Of More Deadly Oil Spills."" Sakishima Went On To Say That This ""Isn't Just Deregulation, It's Willful Ignorance."" Furthermore, Experts Believe We Are Still Years, If Not Decades, Away From Fully Understanding The Extent Of The Damage From The 2010 Deepwater Horizon Spill. This Is Made Evident By Many Of The Environmental Impacts We Are Still Seeing Today, Including The Detection Of Deepwater Horizon Oil In Migratory Bird's Eggs 1,000 Miles Away In Minnesota, Increased Mortality Rates For Bottlenose Dolphins And Severe Physical Abnormalities Among Bluefin And Yellowfin Tuna Populations. Many Of Florida's Coastal Communities Are Still Reeling From The Oil Spill And Additional Resources Are Needed To Help These Areas Fully Recover. To This End, Bp Announced An Additional $1.7 Billion For Clean-Up Costs Related To The Oil Spill, Which Now Totals Roughly $65 Billion, And The Company Anticipates Further Payments Of Nearly $3 Billion In 2018 To Aid Those Seeking Damages. If These Safeguards Are So Burdensome Then Why Is The Oil Industry Enjoying Record Profits? The U.s. Is Currently Producing Over 10 Million Barrels Of Oil Per Day - A Level We Have Not Reached Since The 1970s, Rivaling The World's Top Producer, Russia. The Gulf Of Mexico Accounted For Nearly 21 Percent Of All U.s. Crude Oil Production In 2017, And With That Number Expected To Increase In 2018 And Beyond, Now Is Not The Time To Place Lives And Our Environment At Risk By Lifting These Important Safeguards. Florida's Coastal Communities Depend On A Clean And Healthy Ocean And We Should Not Jeopardize The State's Economy Or Environment By Gambling On Operations That Lack Adequate Safeguards. While The Environmental Impact Of The Spill Was Immense And Visible For All To See, Floridians Also Recall The Vast Economic Damage Done To The State, Which Totaled Around $3 Billion In Lost Visitor Spending Revenue, $182.5 Million In Lost Sales Tax, And 48,000 Lost Jobs. That Is Why I Am Asking You To Reject Any Proposals To Roll Back Regulations That Were Specifically Adopted To Address Safety Failures That Led To The 2010 Deepwater Horizon Spill. My Constituents Were Severely Impacted By The Deepwater Horizon Spill, And We Strongly Oppose Any Effort To Weaken These Common-Sense Regulations That Protect Against Another Oil Spill Off The Coast Of Florida. I Urge You To Reject These Ill-Advised Proposals. Don't Weaken Safety Regulations For Off-Shore Oil Rigs. Thank You For Your Time And Consideration, And I Look Forward To Your Prompt Response On This Critically Important Matter.

Boem Disagrees That An Iop Will Need To Be Updated Whenever An Ep Is Updated. An Iop Is Required For Each Exploratory Drilling Program Planned By An Operator. However, A Single Iop May Cover Multiple Eps When Sufficient Geographic And Operational Overlap Exists. The Iop Serves Its Primary Purpose Before An Ep Is Submitted, As It Informs The Early Planning Process Prior To Initial Ep Submission. Requiring The Iop To Be Updated After The Ep's Submission Would Not Serve Any Practical Purpose, Because The Ep Serves As The Main Point Of Reference For Both Agencies And The Operator After The Ep Is Filed.",NA,Adding A Paragraph To Clarify,NA,Disagrees,NA,Bsee,Https://Ssc.wisc.edu/~Judgelord/Comment_text/Bsee/Bsee-2013-0011-0045/Bsee-2013-0011-0045-1.Txt,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Bsee,2015-04-27,Obama,1,4,FALSE,1,FALSE,FALSE,0,31,1.4375,26,-1.2580645161290325,TRUE,-1.2580645161290325,1,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,53,11-100,1-99,Opposes Rule,Opposes Rule,Shell,Bsee,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Mass-Comment Campaign,Business

The Proposed Rule Would Guarantee Overtime Pay Only For Salaried Workers Earning Up To $35,308 A Year, And Would Replace A Far Stronger Proposal Put Forward By President Obamas Administration That Would Have Ensured Overtime Pay For Workers Earning Up To $47,0476 By 2016 Phasing Up To $55,068 A Year. Nationally, An Estimated 8.2 Million Workers Would Be Left Behind By The Trump Administrations Proposal, According To Economic Policy Institute Estimates. The 8.2 Million Workers Who Would Be Left Behind Include 4.2 Million Women, 3.0 Million People Of Color, 4.7 Million Workers Without A College Degree, And 2.7 Million Parents Of Children Under The Age Of 18. Overall, U.s. Workers Will Lose $1.2 Billion Dollars Each And Every Year Under This Weaker Proposal. In Michigan, Approximately 192,000 Fewer Workers Would Be Guaranteed Overtime Protection Under The Departments Weak Proposal, Which Effectively Treats Workers Who Are Paid At Least $35,308 A Year As Highly Paid Executives Who Dont Need Overtime. Already, Since The Trump Administration Abandoned President Obamas Overtime Proposal, Michigan Workers Have Lost More Than $56 Million In Overtime Pay A Pay Cut That Is Hurting Our States Working Families And Our Economy. The Trump Administrations Proposal Would Hurt Efforts To Protect Michigans Middle-Class Workers, And To Ensure That Workers Who Must Work Long Hours Away From Their Families Are Paid Fairly For Their Time And Dedication. Even Worse, The Trump Administrations Proposal Would Not Be Indexed To Increase In Future Years To Keep Pace With Rising Wages And Living Costs, And Instead Would Remain Frozen At Just $35,308. The Proposed Rule Provides The Least Protection To Workers In Low Wage Industries Who Need The Protections Of The Most. The Current Proposal Does Not Fix The Key Problem With Current Law: The Proposed Salary Level Is Still Far Too Low Given That The Duties Test Allows Workers To Perform A Disproportionate Amount Of Nonexempt Work While Still Qualifying For The Overtime Exemption. This Combination Means That The Proposed Rule Fails To Adequately Protect Workers Who Are Not Executive, Administrative, Or Professional (Eap) Employees In Any Meaningful Sense. For These Reasons, The Proposed Rule Departs From Decades Of Historical Precedent And Undercuts The Purposes Of The Fair Labor Standards Acts Overtime Provisions. The Department Must Either Raise The Proposed Salary Level Significantly Or Strengthen The Duties Test In The Final Rule And Provide A Concrete Rule For Regularly Updating The Salary Level In Order To Realize Fully The Promises Of The Flsa. The Departments Low Proposed Salary Level Is Entirely Insufficient To Assure That Employees Who Can Pass The Current Duties Test Are Truly Bona Fide Exempt Employees. Given The Weak Duties Test In Place, The Proposed Salary Test Will Allow Employees To Be Exempt Even Though They Are Performing Such A Disproportionate Amount Of Nonexempt Work That They Are Not Eap Employees In Any Meaningful Sense. For These Reasons, The Proposed Rule Does Not Effectively Advance The Purposes Of The Flsas Overtime Provisions. Raising The Salary Threshold To A Level More Comparable To The Obama Administrations Proposal Would Go A Long Way Towards Remedying This Issue, As It Would Eliminate The Need For A More Stringent Duties Test And Reduce The Number Of Workers Who Are Inappropriately Classified As Exempt And Underpaid.over Time, The Departments Inaction In This Area Has Already Undermined The Flsas Overarching Purpose To Extend Pay Protections Broadly And Exempt Only A Small Share Of The Workforce From Coverage. The Departments Overtime Proposal Simply Does Not Do Enough To Restore Overtime Pay For Workers In Michigan Or Establish The Type Of Strong National Standard That The Departments Overtime Rules Set In Decades Past. We Respectfully Urge The Department To Reconsider Its Proposal And Instead Adopt A More Adequate Salary Level Comparable To The Obama Administrations Proposal, Or In The Alternative Strengthen The Duties Test, And Include The Addition Of A Clear Proposal For Indexing.
