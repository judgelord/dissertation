## Theory {#why-theory}


### Forms and Drivers of Civic Participation 

Civic engagement includes participation in letter-writing campaigns, petitions, protests, hearings [@Verba1987]. Importantly, @Verba1987 distinguish "citizen-initiated contacts" from "cooperative activity" (pg. 54). Cooperative activities are coordinated and mediated through an organization.
By coordinating political action, public pressure campaigns expand civic participation in policymaking.^[I follow @Verba1987 in defining "civic participation" as "acts aimed at influencing governmental decisions" [@Verba1987 p. 2]. However, some argue that
participation only counts if it is deliberative, which mass comment campaigns are not, at least not at the individual level.<!--@Goodin2006-->
Other criteria posed by normative theorists that participation should be "genuine," "informed," or "reasoned" are more difficult to assess. Normative theorists debate whether deliberation among a small number of people is preferable to a large number of people simply expressing their preferences. But empirically, public participation in bureaucratic policymaking is much more the latter [@Shapiro2008b].]

Self-selection may not be ideal for representation, but
opt-in participation---whether voting, attending a hearing, or writing a
comment---may often be one of the few heuristics decisionmakers have
about public preferences. Campaigns inform agencies about the
distribution and intensity of opinions that are often too nuanced to
estimate a priori. However limited and slanted, this information is directed at policymakers who may often be unclear how the public and other political institutions will react to their policy decisions. Many questions that arise in rulemaking lack
analogous public opinion polling questions, making mass commenting a
unique source of political information. As with public opinion on most
specific policy issues, most members of the public and their elected
representatives may only learn about the issue and take a position as a
result of a public pressure campaign [@Hutchings2003]. 


> TODO: PLURALIST THEORIES AND GROUP MEDIATION

Forms of civic participation beyond voting, such as protests and petitioning, offer unique opportunities for minority interests. Protests to be an effective mechanism for minority interests to communicate preferences to policymakers when electoral mechanisms fail to do so. Policymakers learn and take informational cues from political behaviors like protests (@Gillion2013). @CarpenterPetitions finds similar potential for petitions to serve as a channel to raise "new claims" and influence policy beyond elections: "Petition democracy offer another model of aggregation, where numerical minorities could still make a case of quantitive relevance" (pg. 479). Numbers matter for protests and petitions, regardless of whether they represent a majority. These modes of preference aggregation often claim to represent a substantial segment of the public, perhaps a larger portion than those as passionately opposed to them.

### The Role of Organized Groups 

Interest groups play a critical role in American politics. 

Mobilizing citizens and generating new political information (information about the distribution and intensity of policy preferences and demands) are key functions of interest groups in a democracy [@Mansbridge1992; @Mahoney2007].




> TODO: Review Truman, Dahl, Mansbridge

As Hacker and Pierson (Forthcoming) observe, 

>" [The United States'] institutional terrain advantages political actors with the capacity to work across multiple venues, over extended periods, and in a political environment where coordinated government action is difficult, and strategies of evasion and exit from regulatory constraints are often successful. These capacities are characteristic of organized groups, not individual voters."


#### Businesses 

Businesses and their associations are particularly influential organizations.

#### Membership Organizations 

> TODO: @March1984a, industry associations, unions, etc

> "The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees ("AFSCME") represents 1.6 million state and local government, health care and child care workers and we write to express our strong support of the proposed rule" ([IRS-2016-0015-0133](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/IRS-2016-0015-0133))

Some membership organizations join to form larger federations.  

> "The Coalition on Human Needs, which represents more than 100 national member organizations and maintains a network of tens of thousands of individuals and groups nationwide, strongly supports the proposed rule" ([IRS-2016-0015-0131](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/IRS-2016-0015-0131))

Membership organizations often claim to represent more than their membership. 

While political science theories often assume that membership organizations advocate on behalf of somewhat exclusive private interests, they also lobby for their members' broader public preferences [@CITE]. For example, healthcare worker unions frequently lead policy campaigns focused on public health and even issues like climate change.

#### Advocacy Organizations and the Mobilization of Interest


> TODO pressure groups, policy advocacy groups, citizen groups [@Berry1999], policy change organizations [@McNutt2005], petitions [@CarpenterPetitions]

Organizations may use phone banks, targeting strategies,
    and direct-mail techniques to drum up and channel public support [@Cooper1985].
    
Advocacy organizations work together on campaigns. For example, "Save our Environment," which collected signatures from hundreds of thousands of people, is a small nonprofit with a simple WordPress website almost entirely dedicated to mobilizing public comments. It is run by The Partnership Project, a coalition of 20 of the largest environmental advocacy organizations in the US, including the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, Greenpeace, and the World Wildlife Fund, with the aim of "harnessing the power of the internet to increase public awareness and activism on today's most important environmental issues." <!--Several Partnership Project members, including the Sierra Club, EarthJustice, and NRDC, also mobilized hundreds of thousands of their own supporters to comment separately.-->
    
<!-- move below to methods?---> 
    
Advocacy organizations often claim to represent a large number of "members and supporters" (e.g. [FWS-HQ-ES-2018-0007-47165](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/FWS-HQ-ES-2018-0007-47165))
For example, in its comment on proposed regulations on internet gambling, the Poker Players Alliance claimed to represent "more than 840,000 poker enthusiast members" (TREAS-DO-2007-0015-0118). Many of these people became "members" when they signed up to play a free online poker game. However, the organization did claim to have mobilized over 150,000 letters to members of Congress, which, if true, would indicate a somewhat active membership. 

The potential for "cheap talk" in claims of representation is a problem for the ability of groups to communicate credible political information.

To mobilized broader support, advocacy organizations often engage smaller organizations to mobilize their members as well. For example, in a campaign targeting fishing regulations, in addition to mobilizing thousands of individuals, the Pew Charitable Trusts mobilized members of the New York Underwater Photography Society and hundreds of restaurants that serve sustainable seafood. These smaller organizations did not identify themselves as part of Pew's campaign, but their letters used almost identical language.

 

### Group Conflict in Democratic Theory 

> TODO @Dahl1985, @Schattschneider1975, @Kollman1998

Organized groups play at least two key functions in a large democracy: (1) organizing and mobilizing people around ideas and interests and (2) sophisticated lobbying to affect policy. 


<!--conflicgt expansion-->
An organization and can reshape the political environment by expanding the scope of conflict [@Schattschneider1975]. 

<!--going public-->
Political actors bring new people into a political fight through press releases, mass mailing, and phonebanking--strategies known as "going public" [@Kollman1998].  
"Going public," "outside lobbying," or an "outside strategy" contrasts with insider lobbying. Political actors "go public" when they expand the scope of conflict beyond the usual cadre of political actors. This strategy is used by Presidents [@Kernell2007], Members of Congress [@Malecha2012], interest groups
    [@Walker1991; @Dur2013], and even Lawyers and Judges [@Davis2011]. For example, organizations may use phone banks, targeting strategies,
    and direct-mail techniques to drum up and channel public support [@Cooper1985].
    For example, when presidents are in difficult negotiations with Congress, they often use their bully pulpit to mobilize segments of the public to pressure elected representatives. Likewise, interest groups mobilize segments of the public to policymakers as part of their lobbying strategy.
The ability to mobilize a large number of people can thus be a valuable political resource.

### Theories of Bureaucratic Policymaking

<!--Scholars of bureaucratic policymaking have focused on
the sophisticated lobbying efforts of powerful interest groups such as
business coalitions. -->
Theories of bureaucratic policymaking have focused more on the lobbying than mobilizing functions of interest groups. 
Foundational scholarship on rulemaking [@Furlong2005; @Furlong1997; @Furlong1998; @Kerwin2011] focuses on interest group lobbying. Theoretical models focus on how agencies learn about policy problems, negotiate or avoid accountability to various principals, or balance interest-group demands.^[On learning, see @Kerwin2011 and empirical studies by @Yackee2012,
    @Cook2017, @Gordon2018, and @Walters2019. See @Gailmard2017 and
    @Libgober2018 for information-based models where comments reveal information to the agency.
    On accountability to elected officials, see @Furlong1997, @Nou2016,
    @Potter2016, @Woods2018, and @Yackee2009RegGov. 
    @Potter2014dis develops a signaling model where agencies propose and principals veto rules depending, in part, on their beliefs about interest group preferences.
    On interest-group balancing, see @Yackee2006JOP, @Yackee2006JPART,
    and @Kerwin2011. A key assumption of Libgober's (2018) model is that
    bureaucrats have a distribution of preferences over interest group
    positions, about which they are uncertain unless groups reveal their
    preferences through commenting.]
    
  > TODO TRANSITION TO CONCLUSION 

The key insight from this scholarship is that
technical information is the currency of insider lobbying. Figure
\@ref(fig:causal-classic) illustrates the classic causal
model of insider lobbying that describes most rulemakings and nearly all
scholarship on lobbying in bureaucratic policymaking to date.^[Diamonds indicate observable choices, ovals indicate latent preferences, and rectangles indicate information.]

```


<!--Most scholars are skeptical that public pressure can affect rulemaking.-->

To the extent that scholars address the input of ordinary people at all, both
existing theory and empirical scholarship suggest skepticism that non-sophisticated actors merit scholarly attention. (By "ordinary" people, I simply mean people who are not
professional policy influencers.)
Empirical scholarship finds that economic elites and business groups
dominate American politics in general [@Jacobs2005,@Soss2007, @Hertel-Fernandez2019, @Hacker2003, @Gilens2014] and rulemaking in
particular. While some are optimistic that requirements for agencies to
solicit and respond to public comments on proposed rules allow "civil
society" to provide public oversight [@Michaels2015; @Metzger2010], most
studies find that participants in rulemaking often represent elites and
business interests [@Seifter2016UCLA; @Crow2015; @Wagner2011; @West2009; @Yackee2006JOP; @Yackee2006JPART; @Golden1998; @Haeder2015; @Cook2017; @LibgoberCarpenter2018].
<!--
From a strategic perspective, agency officials are not directly
accountable to voters. And even if organized groups do supplement
congressional and judicial checks on executive power, the groups that
participate in rulemaking represent only certain (if any) segments of
the public and may not represent them well [@Seifter2016UCLA].-->


The contentious politics of mobilizing and countermobilizing that inspires most public engagement in policymaking have no place in leading models of bureaucratic policymaking and have largely been ignored by political scientists.

<!--These bursts of civic participation may affect
rulemaking [@Coglianese2001], but **this intuition has yet to be tested.**-->



### Incorporating Political Information {#why-mobilize}

<!--% MAIN QUESTION 
### Incorporating mass engagement into theories of bureaucratic policymaking.--> 
How, if at all, should scholars incorporate public pressure into models of bureaucratic policymaking?
Because the role that public pressure may play in policymaking depends on who mobilized it and why, the first task is to develop testable theories about the drivers of public participation.  

In this section, I first develop two theories about the drivers of public participation in bureaucratic policymaking, one rooted in theories of group conflict and democratic politics and the other rooted in existing theories of interest-group lobbying in bureaucratic policymaking. I then offer a synthetic theory that specifies the conditions under which we should see different kinds of public pressure campaigns. I argue that mass engagement produces potentially valuable political information about the coalition that mobilized it. To the extent that groups aim to influence policy, public pressure is a compliment, not a substitute to sophisticated lobbying. Public pressure supports sophisticated lobbying. This can take several forms. 

#### "Ususal Suspects" or "Underdogs"

Political information may play two distinct roles in policymaking with opposite effects depending on who mobilized it. The normative and empirical import of public pressure campaigns thus turns on who is behind them. 

To the extent that well-resourced groups (the "usual suspects") use public pressure campaigns to create a misleading impression of public support (often called "astroturf"), their role is to strengthen and legitimize demands of the same powerful interests that dominate bureaucratic policymaking. Here, just as groups with superior resources use them to flood policymakers with technical information [@Wagner2010], astroturf campaigns convert economic resources into political information in the form of an impression of public support generated by signatures or form letters. Even groups with few members or a narrow or non-existent base of support among the public may create the appearance of public support by sponsoring pressure campaigns. If the powerful business groups that dominate other forms of lobbying also dominate public pressure campaigns, these campaigns (and perhaps public comment periods themselves) are normatively suspect, merely providing a democratic veneer to economic power. Empirically, we would then expect public pressure campaigns to further advantage the most well-resourced interests. 

Alternatively, to the extent that public interest groups use public pressure campaigns are used as conflict expansion tactics by less-resourced groups ("underdogs"), their role is the opposite: to push back against powerful interests that dominate bureaucratic policymaking. The political information created by conflict expansion can reveal existing and potential support among attentive segments of the public. Through public pressure campaigns, groups that lack financial resources can convert latent public support into concrete political information that may cause policymakers to update their beliefs and change their behavior.  
If mass commenting is mainly a vehicle for public interest groups to convert a latent base of public support into influential political information supporting their representational claims or shining light on the policy process, public comment periods may yet serve some of the informing, balancing, and democratic functions that practitioners and normative theorists desire. Empirically, we would then expect public pressure campaigns to disadvantage well-resourced interests that dominate most policy processes. 

<!--  % %  I theorize that activists' opportunities and strategies and latent public opinion drive engagement. -->

#### The Conditions Under Which Public and Private Interests Mobilize

This section offers a synthesis of theory on interest group lobbying and conflict expansion and hypotheses to explain variation in mass
engagement. 
First, I offer a framework for assessing the causes of mass engagement.
Next, I argue that organizations may mobilize large numbers of people
for several reasons with observable implications for observed patterns of
mass engagement and theoretical implications for predicted effects on
policy.



<!-- in 01-influence: -->
#### Public Pressure as a Resource

An organization's ability to expand the scope of conflict by mobilizing
a large number of people can be a valuable political resource [@Schattschneider1975, @Kollman1998]. 
In contrast to scholars who focus on the deliberative
potential of public comment processes, I focus on public engagement as a
tactic aimed at gaining power. Scholars who understand mobilization
as a tactic [@Furlong1997; @Kerwin2011] have focused on how
organizations mobilize their membership. I expand on this understanding of mobilization as a lobbying tactic to include the broader audiences that are often mobilized by policy advocacy organizations and pressure groups. The broader audiences mobilized through public pressure campaigns are more akin to the concept of
an attentive public [@Key1961] or issue public [@Converse1964].

Here I build on three insights. First, @Furlong1997 and @Kerwin2011
identify mobilization as a tactic. The organizations that they surveyed
reported that forming coalitions and mobilizing large numbers of people
are among the most effective lobbying tactics. Second, @Nelson2012
identify political information as a potentially influential result of
lobbying by different business coalitions. While they focus on
mobilizing experts, I argue that @Nelson2012 describe a dynamic that can be extended
to public pressure campaigns:

> "strategic recruitment, we theorize, mobilizes new actors to participate in the policymaking process, bringing with them novel technical and political information. In other words, when an expanded strategy is employed, leaders activate individuals and organizations to participate in the policymaking process who, without the coordinating efforts of the leaders, would otherwise not lobby. This activation is important because it implies that coalition lobbying can generate new information and new actors---beyond simply the 'usual suspects' ---relevant to policy decisionmakers."

Regarding political information, I extend this logic extends to
non-experts. The number and distribution of ordinary supporters may
matter because it suggests a *public* consensus, at least among some segments of the attentive public. Instead of bolstering
*scientific* claims, a perceived public consensus bolsters *political*
claims. To understand why groups
organize public pressure campaigns, we must understand mass mobilization can be a tactic
aimed at producing political information.

While most scholars have emphasized the lack of useful technical information in mass comments, a few have raised their role in creating
political information. @Cuellar2005 calls on agencies to pay more
attention to ordinary peoples' expressions of preference and @Rauch2016
suggests that agencies reform the public comment process to include
opinion polls. 

I build from a similar intuition that public pressure
campaigns currently function like a poll or, more accurately, a petition, capturing the intensity of preferences among the attentive
public---i.e., how many people are willing to take the time to
engage. Indeed, many campaigns use the language of public opinion and petitioning. For example, a campaign by the World Wildlife Federation provided
    language explicitly claiming to have public opinion on their side.
    Their model comment cited an opinion poll, stating that "Along with 80% of the American
    people, I strongly support ending commercial trade in elephant ivory
    in the U.S." This suggests that public pressure campaigns aim to signal
    information about public opinion.
    A coalition led by another environmental group, Oceana, framed its mass mobilization effort to curb the
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's 2017 Proposed Offshore Oil and Gas
Leasing Program as a "petition signed by 67,275 self-proclaimed United
States residents," suggesting that organizations consider some mass-comment campaigns to effectively be petitions. In the same statement, Oceana also claimed the
support of "more than 110 East Coast municipalities, 100 Members of
Congress, 750 state and local elected officials, and 1,100 business
interests, all of whom oppose offshore drilling," suggesting that claims
of public and elected official support aim to provide similar kinds of
political information.
    
Public pressure campaigns reveal the intensity of passions in attentive segments of the public. Pressure campaigns may presage or co-occur with other efforts like protests and lobbying Congress, thus offering information about other likely political developments.

Building on theories of group conflict in democratic politics, I consider
public demands to be a latent factor in my model of policymaking (Figure
\@ref(fig:causal-whymail). Public demands shape the decisions of
groups who lobby. If they believe the attentive public could be rallied to their cause, groups may attempt to reveal this political information
to policymakers by launching a public pressure campaign. That is, the extent to which latent public demands align with a group's demands will affect its lobbying strategy, specifically whether it decides to launch a public pressure campaign. 

Figure \@ref(fig:causal-whymail) amends the "Classic Model" of interest
group lobbying (Figure \@ref(fig:causal-classic)) to incorporate public pressure campaigns and political information about the attentive public. *In addition to* providing technical information through sophisticated comments, an organization may mobilize supporters to produce political information. This is a key feature of the model: political information is mobilized *in support of* a lobbying coalition's sophisticated legal or technical lobbying effort, not as an alternative to sophisticated lobbying. 

The more latent public support a group has, the more successful this mobilization effort will be. 
The public
response to the campaign (observed as the sale of public engagement in the policy process) depends on the extent that the attentive public
is passionate about the issue. A broader and more passionate attentive public will yield a larger scale of mass engagement than a narrower, less passionate segment base of public support. Thus the observed scale of mass engagement on a given side of a conflict can reveal political information about segments of the public. Large-scale engagement may produce several types of relevant political
information. The most direct and obvious is the expressed "public
opinion" that policymakers observe.^[I address other types of political information that mass engagement may create elsewhere. For an expanded model, see Figure
    \@ref(fig:causal-full). 
]

The causal process visualized in Figure
\@ref(fig:causal-whymail) may only operate under certain conditions. For example, the success of a mobilizing effort depends on whether a group's perception of latent public demands (the diagonal arrow between "Latent Public Demands" and "Lobbying Strategy") reflects the public response to a mobilizing effort (the horizontal arrow between "Latent Public Demands" and "Mass Engagement"). Additionally, policymaking institutions have different mechanisms for processing and incorporating technical and political information (the arrows between "technical information" or "political information" and "policy response").

```{r causal-whymail, fig.cap = "Incorporating Political Information into Models of Bureaucratic Policymaking"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "causal-whymail.png"))

```

Because lobbying organizations likely have some idea of the level of public support for their positions, one observable implication of this model is that lobbying organizations will be more likely to launch a public pressure campaign when they have more public support (i.e., where latent public support is a resource). 

Instead of a public pressure campaign aimed at mobilizing supporters, a lobby organization may attempt to bypass mass engagement by producing fake evidence of public support. However, as I describe below, this is a risky strategy. 

#### Second-order Representation

When lobbying during rulemaking, groups often
make dubious claims to represent broad segments of the public
[@Seifter2016UCLA]. If agency staff do not trust an organizations'
representational claims, engaging actual people may be one of the few
credible signals of a broad base of support.  This is especially true when
organizations claim to represent people beyond their official members; comments may be the best way to support those claims. 
For example, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a top mobilizer of public comments, often claims to represent "3 million members
and online activists" (https://www.nrdc.org/about), presumably including anyone who has donated to or participated in one of its campaigns. Mobilizing comments is one way that NRDC can demonstrate actual support for their position on any given issue.

Furthermore, if advocacy
group decisions are primarily made by D.C. professionals, these
advocates themselves may be unsure how broadly their claims resonate
until potentially attentive publics are actually engaged.

Theorists debate whether signing a petition of support without
having a role in crafting the appeal is a meaningful voice and whether
petitions effectively channel public interests, but, at a minimum,
engaging a large number of supporters may help broader interests to
distinguish themselves from truly narrower ones. It suggests that the
organization is not entirely "memberless" [@Skocpol2003] in the sense that it
can demonstrate some verifiable public support. An organization mobilizing its members or supporters to take some action lends weight to representational claims that might otherwise be indistinguishable from cheap talk claims that groups often make to represent broad constituencies.

The credibility of the signal that mass engagement provides may be complicated by "astroturf" campaigns, where organizations aim to evoke the image of a larger base of support than they really have. To the extent that support can be effectively faked or inflated using "astroturf" tactics, the political information that pressure campaigns provide will be less accurate and thus valuable to decisionmakers. 

Astroturf campaigns that utilize faked evidence of mass support (e.g., faked petition signatures) bypass the public pressure and mass engagement step entirely, manifesting false political information. However, in a model where political information is a compliment to technical information, supporting a sophisticated lobbying effort, utilizing fake political information is a risky strategy. Organizations lobbying in repeated interactions with agencies, and an organization's reputation--critical to its ability to provide credible technical information--may be severely harmed if policymakers lean that an organization provided false political information. One observable implication is thus that astroturf campaigns will often be used anonymously or by organizations that do not also engage in sophisticated lobbying in order to provide sophisticated lobbying organizations plausible deniability. Because policymakers may rationally discount petitions submitted anonymously or by groups that lack reputations for credibility, fraudulent campaigns have little hope of influencing policy in this model and may thus be fairly rare compared to a model where political information is not mediated by groups that also engage in sophisticated lobbying. 


### Types of Pressure Campaign Motivations

<!--should this be in theory?-->

The effects of public pressure campaigns depend, in part, on the aims of a
campaign. Campaigns may pursue four distinct aims: (1) to win concessions by *going public*, (2) to *disrupt a perceived consensus*, or (3) to satisfy some audience other than policymakers by *going down fighting* when they anticipate losing or (4) to satisfy some audience other than policymakers by *credit claiming* when they anticipate winning. Going public and disrupting a perceived consensus are, respectively, forms of proactive and reactive outside lobbying. Going down fighting and credit claiming to describe
situations where the organization mobilizes for reasons other than influencing policy, like engaging or recruiting members. In many cases, "going public" as a lobbying strategy is simultaneously an opportunity to engage and recruit members, so organizations **going public** to influence policy and engage in power-building tactics, especially *credit claiming*. For example, Sierra club organized several campaigns around thanking the Obama EPA for new draft environmental policies and the agency to not back down, thus simultaneously engaging members, implying that the Sierra Club had advanced its policy agenda, and pressure policymakers to hold course or strengthen policy rather than bend to countervailing industry pressures.

**Going public.** Coalitions "go public" when they believe that
expanding the scope of conflict gives them an advantage. As coalitions that "go public" should believe they have more intense public
support, mass engagement is likely to skew heavily toward this side.

Going public is likely to be used by those disadvantaged (those
    @Schattschneider1975 calls the 'losers') in a policy process with
    less public attention.
Indeed, looking at a sample of rules from the Environmental Protection Agency, @Potter2017 finds that advocacy group-driven campaigns mobilize
far more people on average than industry-driven campaigns. Additionally,
many people may be inspired indirectly (e.g., through news stories) or
to engage with more effort (e.g., writing longer public comments) than people
mobilized by the side with less public support. This is important
because political information may be especially influential if
decisionmakers perceive a consensus. For example, the level of consensus among interest groups
    [@Golden1998; @Yackee2006JPART], especially business unity
    [@Yackee2006JOP; @Haeder2015], predicts policy change.^[It is not clear if the power of coalition unity is a result of strategic calculation by policymakers, a perceived obligation due to the normative power of consensus (e.g., following a majoritarian logic [@Dahl1989; @Mendelson2011]), or simply that unified demands are easier to process than opposing demands.



**Disrupting a perceived consensus.** I theorize that when coalitions
with less public support mobilize, it is a reaction to their opponents.
Because the impression of consensus is potentially powerful, when a coalition goes
public, an opposing coalition may countermobilize. Because these are coalitions with less intense public support, and their aim
is to prevent a perceived consensus, I expect such campaigns to engage
fewer people, less effort per person, and yield a smaller portion of
indirect engagement. In the extreme, these campaigns are astroturf, relying on various forms of deception to compensate for their lack of genuine public support.



**Credit claiming** and **going down fighting**. Finally, campaigns may target supporters rather
than policymakers. When they expect to win, organizations may launch a campaign in order to draw attention to and associate themselves with a positive policy development.  When they expect to lose, organizations may "go down fighting" to fulfill
supporters' expectations. Both of these "performative" reasons for organizing a mass comment campaign may help engage existing members and recruit new members.  For example, @CarpenterPetitions finds that many anti-slavery petitions were this type of campaign, where "the most important readers of a
petition are its signatories" rather than the policymakers to whom they are addressed. "Credit claiming" and "going down fighting" 
campaigns are rooted in logics that are internal to the organization,
including member retention or recruitment [@Carpenter2014b; @CarpenterPetitions[], fundraising, or satisfying a
board of directors. For example, as Figure \@ref(fig:sierra) shows, the Sierra Club uses campaigns to collect
contact information of supporters and potential members. Given the executive-branch transition between 2010 when the rule was
initiated and 2017 when it was delayed, the Sierra Club may have had
little hope of protecting methane pollution standards, but for members
of the public who wanted to voice their opinion, the Sierra Club created
an easy way to do so, as long as users consented to "receive periodic
communication from the Sierra Club."


```{r sierra, out.width="40%",fig.cap = "The Sierra Club Collects Contact Information Through Public Pressure Campaigns"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "sierra2.jpeg"))

```


While more performative campaigns may engage many people, they are unlikely to affect
policy or inspire countermobilization. <!--I expect such campaigns to
occur on rules that have high partisan salience (e.g., rules following
major legislation passed on a narrow vote), rules that propose large
shifts on policy issues dear to member-funded public interest groups, or
rulemaking started shortly after presidential transitions when
executive-branch agendas shift more quickly than public opinion.-->

When a lobbying coalition with more intense public support successfully
mobilizes for reasons other than influencing policy, opposing coalitions
with less public support have little reason to countermobilize. Thus, member-funded public interest groups should be more common than campaigns sponsored by narrow private interests, simply because they have more occasions where mobilizing has benefits. Most campaigns sponsored by narrow private interest should occur in opposition to another campaign, but public interest groups have reasons to launch a campaign when policy is unlikely to move, and thus private interests are unlikely to oppose them.

The extent to which a campaign genuinely aims to influence policy or is pursuing other logics may be difficult to distinguish in
the observed public response. Indeed, multiple motivations may drive most campaigns, and members of the public may poorly
understand the different chances of success in each case. 
However, lobbying organization do likely know their chances of success and should
thus invest less in providing technical information when they see little opportunity to affect policy. By identify cases where coalitions engage in large
public campaigns without corresponding investment in Technica, we may be able to assess whether countermobilization and is indeed less
likely in these cases. Table
\@ref(tab:campaigns-patterns) specifies the general pattern of
engagement suggested by each of the above-described driver mass-comment
campaigns.

Table: (\#tab:campaigns-patterns) Observable Differences in Lobbying Strategies
  
| | Inside lobbying (e.g., technical information provided) | Outside lobbying (e.g., the number of comments from a public pressure campaign) |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| "Normal" lobbying | High | None | 
| "Going public" | High | High |
| "Disrupting consensus" | High | Low | 
| "Credit claiming" or Going down fighting" | Low | High |



As Table \@ref(tab:campaigns-patterns) suggests, the relevant statistic
distinguishing patterns is the *relative* level of technical and political information provided by an organization or coalition. Even among rules targeted by
campaigns, salience varies significantly, and thus "high" and "low" numbers of comments will differ across rules. 



#### Public and Private Aims



> TODO: MORE ABOUT PUBLIC VS PRIVATE COALITIONS TO SET UP HYPOTHESES. ESP. ADD MORE ABOUT PRIVATE COALITIONS' RESOURCES 

While lobbying coalitions may form around various material and ideological
conflicts, those most likely to be advantaged by going public, credit claiming, or going
down fighting are public interest groups---organizations primarily
serving a broad idea of the public good rather than the narrow material interests of
their members. And indeed, @Potter2017 finds that advocacy group-driven campaigns mobilize
far more people on average than industry-driven campaigns. Thus, I theorize that mass mobilization is most
likely to occur in conflicts of public versus private interests or
public versus public interests (i.e., between coalitions led by groups
with distinct cultural ideals or desired public goods), provided they
have sufficient resources to run a campaign. If true, one implication is
that mass mobilization will systematically run counter to concentrated
business interests where they conflict with the values of public
interest groups with sufficient resources to mobilize.

Classifying coalitions as primarily driven by private or public interest provides analytic leverage, but scholars have not converged on a single approach to do so. @Potter2017 distinguishes "advocacy groups" from
    "industry groups." @Berry1999 calls these groups "citizen groups" and emphasizes conflict over cultural issues. Some public interest groups focus on conservative or progressive cultural issues, like religious education, immigration, or endangered species. Others are more focused on the public provision or protection of public goods such as national parks, consumer product safety standards, air quality, drinking water, and public safety. Types of membership organizations that are both broad and focused on material outcomes for their members (such as labor unions) are difficult to classify. @Potter2017 puts unions in the "Industry" category.
    I take a different approach based on the coalition with whom such groups lobby. If a union lobbies alongside businesses [see @Mildenberger2020], I classify this as a private interest-driven coalition. If a union lobbies with
    public interest groups on public health or safety issues, I classify
    this as a public interest group coalition.

Another challenge for classifying public and private interest groups is that appeals to the government are almost always couched in the language of
public interest, even when true motivations are private
[@Schattschneider1975]. Public pressure campaigns are no exception, and mobilizing organizations almost always evoke some version of the public interest. <!--However, not all... -->

### Types of Public Engagement

I classify supporters into three types: minimal supporters, passionate supporters, and inspired supporters. The number and ratios of each describe key pieces of
political information. In the context of public
comments, minimal supporters submit comments that are exact copies of a form letter, essentially a petition signature. It is the minimal effort required to participate in a campaign. Commenters that also take time to add their own text to a form letter
indicate more intense preferences. For example, 37,127 commenters mobilized by EarthJustice submitted the same form, but 6,837 of them also added additional personalized comments. Mobilizing organizations often encourage their supporters to write personalized comments and emphasize the number of people who took the time to write personalized comments in their own comments. 
<!--For example, Earthjustice noted the number of people who wrote personalized comments when it uploaded its mass comment campaign. "Attached is the file containing the names of 37,127 individuals who have submitted public comments urging the Environmental Protection Agency to ban organophosphate and carbamate pesticides. In addition to signing on in support of the following letter, 6,837 individuals of the total number have submitted personalized comments." ([EPA-HQ-OPP-2012-0161-0087](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OPP-2012-0161-0087))] -->

Finally, commenters who express
solidarity in similar but distinct phrases indicate they were inspired
indirectly, perhaps by a news story or a social media post about the campaign, as campaign messages spread beyond those initially
targeted.^[It is possible that some people in this latter category engage purely on their own initiative, but any impact they have likely comes from their alignment with a coalition. Furthermore, as I show
    below, wholly original comments are rare.] 
    
The size of each group offers political information to
policymakers, including coalition resources, the intensity of sentiment,
and the potential for conflict to spread. The first two types signal two
kinds of intensity or resolve. First, they show the mobilizers'
willingness to commit resources to the issue. Second, costly actions
show the intensity of opinions among the mobilized segment of the public
[@Dunleavy1991]. The number of people engaged by a campaign is not
strictly proportional to an organization's investment. The less people
care, the more it costs to mobilize them. The third type indicates
potential contagion. Indications that messages spread beyond those
initially targeted may be especially powerful [@Kollman1998].

Public pressure campaigns thus produce information about organizational resolve, the intensity of public demands, and the potential of the campaign or movement to grow. 

    
### Hypotheses About the Drivers of Mass Mobilization

The observable implications of the theory described above suggest several testable hypotheses. 

First, national politics in the United States is the terrain of organized groups. While observers frequently talk about ordinary people engaging in policymaking as individuals, political science theory suggests that the participation of individuals who are not professional policy influencers will almost always be mediated by an organized group.  
<!--2.1-->
```{hypothesis, meditated, echo = TRUE}
Most people engage in the policy process as a result of organized public pressure campaigns.
```


<!--2.2-->
I argue that public pressure tactics are a compliment, not a substitute for sophisticated technical lobbying. Whereas some previous studies compare mass comment campaigns to technical lobbying efforts, I argue that the relevant unit of analysis is the lobbying coalition and that public pressure is a compliment, not a substitute for sophisticated technical lobbying. 

```{hypothesis, coalitions, echo = TRUE}
Public pressure campaigns are organized by *coalitions* that include groups that engage in sophisticated technical lobbying.
```

When policymaking pits broad public interests against narrower private interests, it is the public interest groups more often incentives to launch public pressure campaigns, both for policy and organizational reasons. Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:public) posits a conditional logic in the
decision to mobilize. If resources drive outside lobbying,
business-driven coalitions should often dominate, as they do elsewhere.
However, I argue, because outside lobbying can alter the decision
environment, those who have the advantage in the usual rulemaking
process (where a more limited set of actors participate) have little
incentive to expand the scope of the conflict. Additionally, I argue, public interest groups have greater incentives than businesses to launch public pressure campaigns for reasons other than influencing policy. 

<!--2.3-->
```{hypothesis, public, echo = TRUE}
Public interest group coalitions mobilize *more often* than private interest group (e.g., business-led) coalitions.
```

Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:public) may be evaluated in absolute terms--whether most public pressure campaigns are launched by public interest groups--or relative terms--whether public interest groups are more likely to lobby with the backing of a public pressure campaign than private interests. 

The
converse could also be true. For example, business groups that are
already advantaged in the policy process may decide to leverage
their superior resources further to mobilize support to alter a bad
reputation or bolster claims that they represent more than their private
interest. If mobilization most often takes this "astroturf" form, this
would be evidence against 
\@ref(hyp:public) and Schattschneider's argument that it is the
disadvantaged who seek to expand the scope of the conflict.



If the success of a mobilization effort is moderated
by latent public support, as my theory asserts, broader public interest group coalitions ought to
mobilize more people, more effort per person, and more people indirectly
for the same amount of mobilization effort (e.g., spending or
solicitations). That is, the scale and the intensity of public engagement depend on preexisting support for
the proposition that people are being asked to support.

<!--2.4-->
```{hypothesis, public-success, echo = TRUE}
Public interest group coalitions mobilize *more successfully* than private interest group (e.g., business-led) coalitions. 
```

Following the typology developed above, indicators of success include (1) the number
of comments supporting a coalition, (2) the effort per comment, and (3) the number of comments mobilized indirectly.

<!--2.5-->
Notwithstanding the incentive structure between coalitions advancing broad public interests and narrow private interests, resources and capacity are still necessary conditions to run a campaign. Most organizations that are
disadvantaged in the policy process also lack resources to launch
mass mobilization campaigns. 

```{hypothesis, resources, echo = TRUE}
Public pressure campaigns targeting national policy are most often run by large national policy advocacy organizations.
```


<!--2.6-->
If private interest groups like businesses primarily use public pressure campaigns to counter a message of public consensus advanced by an opposing lobbying coalition, we should rarely see private interest groups lobbying unopposed. Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:disrupt) would be supported by evidence that public interest group coalitions more often lobby unopposed than private interest groups.

```{hypothesis, disrupt, echo = TRUE}
If narrow private interest groups (e.g., businesses) lunch public pressure campaigns, it is a response to an opposing campaign. 
```



<!--
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:disrupt) would be undermined if lobbying organizations
with less public support are no more likely to engage in outside
lobbying when their opponents do so. 

While @Potter2017 found industry
groups were no more likely to advocate for rules to be strengthened,
weakened or withdrawn, this does not mean that they are not more likely
to mobilize when their opponents do so.
-->









<!--
```{hypothesis, support, echo = TRUE}
Lobbying coalitions
mobilize mass engagement when they perceive the attentive public is on
their side, have sufficient resources, and perceive an opportunity to
influence policy.
```


The key part of Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:support) is that mobilizing is correlated with
existing public support, what might be called "grass-roots" support. 

 It is possible
that the "potentially mobilized" segments of the public are unrelated to
public support before being contacted by the campaign, for example, if
mobilization is driven more by partisan identities than issue
preferences.
-->
<!--If an organization does not perceive a
lobbying opportunity, it would be incorrect to call mobilization a
lobbying strategy. Many factors may contribute to perceived political
opportunities. For example, @Moore2017 finds that agencies that use high
levels of expertise (as defined by @Selin2015) receive fewer comments,
possibly because mobilizing organizations perceive these rules to be
less open to influence.-->
