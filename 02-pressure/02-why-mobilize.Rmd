## Theory: Interest Groups as Mobilizers and Influencers {#why-theory}


Interest groups play a critical role in American politics. As @Hacker2021 observe, 

> [The United States'] institutional terrain advantages political actors with the capacity to work across multiple venues, over extended periods, and in a political environment where coordinated government action is difficult, and strategies of evasion and exit from regulatory constraints are often successful. These capacities are characteristic of organized groups, not individual voters. [@Hacker2021, pg. 3]

Organized groups play at least two key functions in a large democracy: (1) organizing and mobilizing people around ideas and interests and (2) sophisticated lobbying to affect policy [@Truman1951]. The next two subsections address each in turn.

<!--Lowi and Wilson here?-->

### The Mobilization of Interest

Mobilizing citizens and generating new political information (information about the distribution and intensity of policy preferences and demands) are key functions of interest groups in a democracy. Advocacy groups are "intermediaries between public constituencies and government institutions,” which often represent segments of the public with “shared ideologies or issue perspectives" [@Grossmann2012, p. 24]. In doing so, public interest groups provide countervailing forces to business interest groups [@Mansbridge1992].  Engaging citizens to participate in the policy process is a common strategy for groups to gain and exercise power [@Mahoney2007], and thus a major driver of civic engagement [@Skocpol2003; @Dur2007]. Conflict among pressure groups, even those representing private interests, can lead to more majoritarian policy outcomes [@Yackee2009PSJ]. Indeed, pluralist theories of democracy rely on interest groups to represent segments of the population in policymaking [@Dahl1958; @Dahl1961], though they may do so poorly [@Schattschneider1975; @McFarland2007; @Seifter2016UCLA]. 

<!--
Advocacy groups do more than mobilize; they define and articulate latent interests. "most political actors do not make decisions about what is important, including how their material interests are constituted and how to the articulate the necessity of those interests to the wider polity, wholly on the basis of fact-based, cost-benefit analyses. To truly understand how people make choices about what is politically important, we have to take much greater notice of the elements that shape the interpretation of facts, symbols, events, and problems and their solutions." [@Woodly2015, p. 22-23]

#### Forms and Drivers of Civic Participation 

Classic examples of civic engagement include participation in letter-writing, signing petitions, protesting, or attending hearings [@Verba1987]. Importantly, @Verba1987 distinguish "citizen-initiated contacts" with the government from "cooperative activity" (p. 54).
Political behavior research tends to focus on the choices of individuals. For example, survey research on political participation often studies activities like letter-writing as if they are citizen-initiated contacts rather than a group activity. 
Administrative law scholarship often discusses individual participants in rulemaking in a similar way.
@Cuellar2005 finds that members of the "lay public" raise important new concerns beyond those raised by interest groups. He advocates for reforms that would make it easier for individuals to participate and increase the sophistication of individual comments on proposed policies. However, most individual participation is not spontaneous and may be better classified as cooperative.

Cooperative activities are coordinated and mediated through organizations.
By coordinating political action, public pressure campaigns expand civic participation in policymaking. I follow @Verba1987 in defining "civic participation" as "acts aimed at influencing governmental decisions" (p. 2). Some argue that participation only counts if it is deliberative, which mass comment campaigns are not (at least at the individual level).^[For example, @Rossi1997 argues mass comment campaigns are deleterious to civic republican ideals. 
Other criteria posed by normative theorists that participation should be "genuine," "informed," or "reasoned" are more difficult to assess.] Normative theorists debate whether deliberation among a few people is preferable to a large number of people simply expressing their preferences. But empirically, public participation in bureaucratic policymaking is much more the latter [@Shapiro2008]. In terms offered by @Mansbridge2003, public pressure campaigns are more about democratic aggregation than deliberation. @CarpenterPetitions similarly characterized petitioning as "another model of aggregation" (p. 479) beyond elections.

Self-selection may not be ideal for representation, but
opt-in forms of participation---including voting, attending hearings, or
commenting on proposed policies---are often the only information decisionmakers have about public preferences. On any
specific policy issue, most members of the public may only learn about the issue and take a position as a result of a public pressure campaign. Likewise, elected
officials may only learn about the issue and take a position as a
result of a public pressure campaign [@Hutchings2003]. Campaigns inform agencies about the
distribution and intensity of opinions that are often too nuanced to
estimate a priori.  Many questions that arise in rulemaking lack
analogous public opinion polling questions, making mass commenting a
unique source of political information.  However limited and slanted, this information is directed at policymakers who may be unsure how the public and other political actors will react to their policy decisions.

<!--this paragraph is also in EJ, maybe make a footnote or cite--> 
Forms of civic participation beyond voting, such as protests and petitions, offer unique opportunities for minority interests in particular. Protests can be an effective mechanism for minority interests to communicate preferences to policymakers when electoral mechanisms fail to do so. Policymakers learn and take informational cues from political behaviors like protests [@Gillion2013]. @CarpenterPetitions finds similar potential for petitions to serve as a channel to raise "new claims" and influence policy beyond elections: "Petition democracy offers another model of aggregation, where numerical minorities could still make a case of quantitative relevance" (pg. 479). Numbers matter for protests and petitions, regardless of whether they represent a majority. These modes of preference aggregation often claim to represent a substantial segment of the public, perhaps a larger portion than those as passionately opposed to them.


#### Pluralism and Group Conflict in Democratic Theory 

An organization can reshape the political environment by expanding the scope of conflict [@Schattschneider1975]. 
Political actors bring new people into a political fight by using press releases, mass mailing, and phonebanking to drum up and channel public support. Conflict expansion strategies that attempt to engage the broader public are often called "going public" [@Kollman1998].  Going public (also called outside lobbying or an outside strategy) contrasts with insider lobbying. Political actors go public when they expand the scope of conflict beyond the usual cadre of political actors. This strategy is used by presidents [@Kernell2007], members of Congress [@Malecha2012], interest groups
    [@Walker1991; @Dur2013], lawyers [@Davis2011], and even judges [@Krewson2019]. 
    For example, when presidents face difficult negotiations with Congress, they often use their bully pulpit to mobilize segments of the public to pressure elected representatives. Likewise, interest groups mobilize segments of the public to pressure policymakers as part of their lobbying strategy.^[I use "mobilizing" rather than "organizing" because organizing often implies that people are organized in a way that is more enduring than signing a single petition or writing a single letter. Mobilizing implies an activation but not necessarily an enduring organizational structure. More research is needed on the extent to which these mass mobilization campaigns create enduring organization.] 

Organizations that mobilize people to engage in policy debates (e.g., through letter-writing campaigns) go by many names, each with slightly different connotations. These include pressure groups [@Schattschneider1942], policy advocacy groups [@Potter2017; @Grossmann2012], citizen groups [@Berry1999], and policy change organizations [@McNutt2007].

#### Public Pressure as a Resource

<!-- SOME OF THIS REPEATS IN THE NEXT CHAPTER-->

An organization's ability to expand the scope of conflict by mobilizing
a large number of people can be a valuable political resource [@Lipsky1968; @Schattschneider1975; @Kollman1998]. 
In contrast to scholars who focus on the deliberative
potential of public comment processes, I focus on public engagement as a
tactic aimed at gaining power. Scholars who understand mobilization
as a tactic [@Furlong1997; @Kerwin2011] have focused on how
organizations mobilize their membership. I expand on this understanding of mobilization as a lobbying tactic to include the broader audiences that policy advocacy organizations and pressure groups often mobilize. The broader audiences mobilized through public pressure campaigns are more akin to the concept of
an attentive public [@Key1961] or issue public [@Converse1964].

@Furlong1997 and @Kerwin2011
identify mobilization as a tactic. The organizations they surveyed
reported that forming coalitions and mobilizing large numbers of people
were among the most effective lobbying tactics.  Studies of rulemaking stress the importance of issue networks [@Gormley1986; @Golden1998] and coalitions [@Yackee2006JOP; @Nelson2012; @Dwidar2021APSR; @English2019APSA]. Other studies have described how organizations are behind form letter campaigns [@Potter2017; @Balla2018; @Balla2020]. Scholars have thus measured coalitions of organized groups and, separately, attached form letters to mobilizing organizations. I combine both of these approaches: defining mass mobilization as one tactic in coalition lobbying. I consider the lobbying coalition the unit of analysis and thus, unlike prior studies, attribute citizen comments to the coalition that mobilized them (not just the organization).

Second, @Nelson2012 identify political information as a potentially influential result of
lobbying by different business coalitions. While they focus on
mobilizing experts, I argue that the dynamic they describe can be extended
to public pressure campaigns:

> Strategic recruitment, we theorize, mobilizes new actors to participate in the policymaking process, bringing with them novel technical and political information. In other words, when an expanded strategy is employed, leaders activate individuals and organizations to participate in the policymaking process who, without the coordinating efforts of the leaders, would otherwise not lobby. This activation is important because it implies that coalition lobbying can generate new information and new actors---beyond simply the 'usual suspects' ---relevant to policy decisionmakers. [@Nelson2012, p. 343]

Regarding political information, I extend this logic to
non-experts. The number and distribution of ordinary supporters may
matter because it suggests a *public* consensus, at least among some segments of the attentive public. (By "ordinary" people, I simply mean people who are not
professional policy influencers.) Instead of bolstering
*scientific* claims, a perceived public consensus bolsters *political*
claims. To understand why groups
organize public pressure campaigns, we must understand mass mobilization as a tactic
aimed at producing political information.


#### Second-order Representation

The potential for "cheap talk" in claims of representation is a problem for the ability of groups to communicate credible political information.
When lobbying during rulemaking, groups often
make dubious claims to represent broad segments of the public
[@Seifter2016UCLA]. If agency staff do not trust an organizations'
representational claims, then engaging actual people may be one of the few
credible signals of a broad base of support.  This is especially true when
organizations claim to represent people beyond their official members.

Advocacy organizations often claim to represent a large number of "members and supporters" (FWS-HQ-ES-2018-0007-47165).
For example, in its comment on proposed regulations on internet gambling, the Poker Players Alliance claimed to represent "more than 840,000 poker enthusiast members" (TREAS-DO-2007-0015-0118). Many of these people became "members" when they signed up to play a free online poker game. However, the organization also claimed to have mobilized over 150,000 letters to members of Congress, which, if true, would indicate an active base of public support. 

Membership organizations often claim to represent more than their membership. 
While political science theories often assume that membership organizations advocate for the exclusive private interests of their members, many membership organizations also lobby for broader policy agendas [@Ahlquist2013; @Mansbridge1992; @Michener2019]. For example, healthcare worker unions frequently lead policy campaigns focused on public health and even issues like climate change. The link between an organizations' policy agenda and the preferences of its members is sometimes more plausible than others.


Mobilizing people to write or sign public comments is one way---perhaps the best way---for organizations to provide evidence that they represent who they say they do.
For example, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a top mobilizer of public comments, often claims to represent "3 million members and online activists" [@NRDC]---a figure that presumably includes anyone who has donated to or participated in one of its campaigns. Mobilizing comments is one way that NRDC can demonstrate active support for their specific position on a given issue. 

To be sure, agency officials have a large amount of political information about their policy areas before soliciting comments. This information may vary across issues. For example, policymakers may better understand the number of people who support NRDC and their politics than they understand the supporters claimed by the Poker Players Alliance. Still, an organizations' level of effort and the scale and intensity with which the attentive public responds to a pressure campaign may provide information about the politics of a given policy issue. A large showing for a campaign supporting a proposed policy may give bureaucrats a talking point with their political superiors or provide political cover to avoid congressional constraints. A surprising level of opposition may make agency leaders question their political tactics.^[In appendix \@ref(formal) I elaborate on formal models that emphasize the impact of unexpected information in public comments.]

<!-- THE REST OF THIS SECTION NEEDS A REWRITE --> 

Furthermore, if D.C. professionals primarily make advocacy group decisions [@Skocpol2003], these
advocates themselves may be unsure of how broadly their claims resonate
until potentially attentive segments of the public are engaged. A large amount of support may encourage professional policy influences to push officials harder to accommodate their requests.

Theorists debate whether signing a petition of support without
having a role in crafting the appeal is a meaningful voice and whether
petitions effectively channel public interests, but, at a minimum,
engaging a large number of supporters may help broader interests
distinguish themselves from truly narrower ones. It suggests that the organization is not entirely "memberless" [@Skocpol2003] in the sense that it can demonstrate some verifiable public support. An organization mobilizing its members and supporters to take some action lends weight to representational claims that might otherwise be indistinguishable from cheap talk claims that groups often make to represent broad constituencies. Demonstrated grassroots support is political information that may bolster a group's representational claims.

The credibility of the signal that mass engagement provides may be complicated by "astroturf" campaigns, where organizations aim to project the image of a larger base of support than they truly have [@McNutt2007; @Rashin2017]. To the extent that support can be effectively faked or inflated using astroturf tactics, the political information that pressure campaigns provide will be less accurate and thus less valuable to decisionmakers. 

Astroturf campaigns that utilize faked evidence of mass support (e.g., fake petition signatures) bypass the public pressure and mass engagement step entirely, manifesting false political information. However, in a model where political information supports an organization's broader lobbying efforts, providing fake political information is a risky strategy. Organizations lobbying in repeated interactions with agencies and an organization's reputation---critical to its ability to provide credible technical information---may be harmed if policymakers learn that they provided false political information. One observable implication is that astroturf campaigns will often be anonymous or led by organizations that do not also engage in sophisticated lobbying.  This may provide sophisticated lobbying organizations plausible deniability. However, because policymakers should rationally discount petitions submitted anonymously or by unknown organizations, fraudulent campaigns have little hope of influencing policy in this model. Compared to a model where political information is not mediated by groups that also engage in sophisticated lobbying, astroturf campaigns should be fairly rare if my theory is correct.

### Lobbying in Bureaucratic Policymaking


Theories of interest-group influence in bureaucratic policymaking have focused more on sophisticated lobbying than the mobilizing functions of interest groups. Broadly, this scholarship has concluded that
technical information is the currency of insider lobbying and that businesses are best positioned to influence bureaucratic policymaking. Empirical scholarship finds that economic elites and business groups
dominate American politics in general [@Jacobs2005; @Soss2007; @Hertel-Fernandez2019; @Hacker2003; @Gilens2014] and rulemaking in
particular. While some are optimistic that requirements for agencies to
solicit and respond to public comments on proposed rules allow civil society to provide public oversight [@Michaels2015; @Metzger2010], most
studies find that participants in rulemaking often represent elites and
business interests [@Seifter2016UCLA; @Crow2015; @Wagner2011; @West2009; @Yackee2006JOP; @Yackee2006JPART; @Golden1998; @Haeder2015; @Cook2017; @LibgoberCarpenter2018].


Foundational scholarship on rulemaking [@Furlong2005; @Furlong1997; @Furlong1998; @Kerwin2011] focuses on interest group lobbying. Theoretical models and empirical scholarship has focused on how interest groups help agencies learn about policy problems [@Yackee2012; @Gordon2018; @Walters2019]. Formal models of rulemaking [@Gailmard2017; @Libgober2018] are information-based models where public comments reveal information to the agency. Legal and scientific information is so important that flooding policymakers with technical information is a highly effective lobbying strategy [@Wagner2010].


Figure
\@ref(fig:causal-classic) illustrates the "classic model" of insider lobbying that describes most rulemakings and nearly all
scholarship on lobbying in bureaucratic policymaking to date. 
The first step in the policy process is the publication of a draft rule (`r draft`). The first broadly observable step in the rulemaking process is usually an agency publishing a draft rule in the Federal Register.^[As agency rulemaking is my empirical case of policymaking,  I use "rule" and "policy" interchangeably.]
While organized groups certainly shape the content of draft policies [@West2004]<!--@Harter1982; @Chubb1983; -->, the public portion of the policy process begins when the draft is officially published.  Taking the publication of a draft policy as my starting point builds on the idea that "new policies create politics" [@Schattschneider1935]. 

 After learning about the content of the policy, interest groups form concrete opinions about how exactly they would like the policy to change and develop a strategy to achieve their goals (`r strategy`) in the public comment stage of the policy process. 
These demands lead organizations to form lobbying coalitions and lobbying strategies that research may, in theory, observe. 
To date, most studies of rulemaking have focused on the power of expertise and novel technical information that may lead agency officials to re-evaluate their policy decisions (`r policy`). 

```{r causal-classic, fig.cap = "The ``Classic Model'' of Interest Group Lobbying in Bureaucratic Policymaking"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "causal-classic.png"))
```

The contentious politics of mobilizing and countermobilizing that inspires most public engagement in policymaking have no place in leading models of bureaucratic policymaking and have largely been ignored by political scientists. 
To the extent that scholars of bureaucratic policymaking address the input of ordinary people and public pressure campaigns, both
existing theory and empirical scholarship suggest skepticism that non-sophisticated actors merit scholarly attention. 


#### What We Know About Mass Comment Campaigns {#why-mass}

The concept of political information that I build upon comes from studies of lobbying coalitions and tactics [@Furlong1997; @Nelson2012]. However, this core scholarship on bureaucratic policymaking does not explicitly address mass comment campaigns. Indeed, nearly all scholarship on rulemaking excludes mass comments from both theory and data. Even studies that aim to assess the impact of the number of comments on each side exclude mass comments [e.g., @McKay2007]. To the extent that scholarship on the politics of rulemaking addresses the quantity rather than the quality of comments, most focus on the size of lobbying coalitions (i.e., the number of organizations) rather than the scale of public attention or pressure [@Yackee2006JOP; @Nelson2012].


Most theoretical and empirical work addressing mass comment campaigns in rulemaking to date has come from administrative law scholars. @Golden1998 examines eleven rules randomly selected from three agencies, finding "a dearth of citizen commenters." @Cuellar2005 examines three different rules and found many comments from the "lay public" raising issues relevant to agency mandates. However, he finds that comments from the lay public were much less sophisticated than the comments of organizations and thus less likely to be cited by agencies. @Mendelson2011
finds that agencies often discard non-technical comments. While commenting and mobilizing
others to comment has become easier<!--[@Benjamin2006]-->, @Coglianese2006 finds that little
else about the rulemaking process changed. @Sunstein2001 finds that the growth of the internet primarily facilitates more of the same kind of engagement among the "like-minded" (i.e., mass-commenting). 

Political science scholarship on mass comment campaigns is limited to a few published articles [@Shapiro2008; @Schlosberg2007; @Balla2018; @Balla2020], two unpublished dissertations [@Moore2017; @Cook2017]^[The article published from Cook's dissertation [@Cook2018] contains less about mass comment campaigns.], and an online report [@Potter2017]. Small adjacent literature in information technology and public administration journals document fraud in the public comment process [@Rinfret2021] and gaps in training that bureaucrats receive [@Rinfret2019]. @Schlosberg2007 note that form letters differ from other comments. @Shapiro2008 investigates whether the number of public comments relates to the time between the publication of the draft and the final rule. With only nine observations, this study was unable to uncover general patterns but suggests that mass comments may be related to longer rulemaking processes. @Moore2017 finds that agencies that use high
levels of expertise (as defined by @Selin2015) receive fewer comments,
possibly because mobilizing organizations perceive these rules to be
less open to influence.

@Cook2017 examines three controversial Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules during the Obama administration. He found that high levels of public attention made it difficult for any one interest group to dominate. This finding suggests that the effects of lobbying may differ between rules with a lot of public attention and more typical rulemakings, where regulated business groups often dominate or lobby uncontested [@Yackee2006JOP]. Representatives of both environmental and industry groups reported that mass comment campaigns were important. And the EPA noted that the majority of comments supported the proposed rule in all three cases.

One of the most theoretically developed and systematic studies to date is a short Brookings Institution report [@Potter2017] that also focused on Obama-era EPA rules. Across 359 EPA rules, @Potter2017 finds that 16 percent were subject to a mass comment campaign. She concludes that "advocacy groups and industry pursue different strategies with respect to comment campaigns." In contrast to most forms of lobbying (which are dominated by industry groups), pressure campaigns are a tool mostly used by advocacy groups. Here, a "campaign" is form-letter comments associated with an organization (as identified by the EPA). On average, campaigns by advocacy organizations generated twice as many comments as industry-sponsored campaigns. Industry-sponsored campaigns were smaller and less likely to identify the sponsoring organization. Industry groups were much less likely to lobby unopposed than advocacy groups. That is, industry groups almost never sponsored campaigns on rules where environmental groups had not, but environmental groups sponsored campaigns even when industry groups did not. @Potter2017 also finds that most mass comment campaigns supported EPA rules under Obama, with advocacy organizations in support and industry campaigns split between support and opposition.

<!--MOVE TO NEXT CHAPTER?-->
In addition to extending Potter's empirical work distinguishing the behavior of advocacy organizations and industry groups, I build on her theorizing about the possible reasons for sponsoring campaigns. Potter argues that public pressure campaigns can expand the scope of the conflict, help grow and maintain advocacy organizations, and give agency leaders political cover to pursue policies in the face of opposition. This chapter explicitly builds on these first two intuitions---how pressure campaigns expand the scope of conflict and grow advocacy organizations. Chapter \@ref(influence) addresses the third---how public pressure campaigns may affect agency leaders' political principals. 

@Balla2018 also focuses on Obama-era EPA rules. They find campaigns occur across issue areas, including complex and economically significant actions. They find broad societal constituencies---such as environmentalists---to be more active in sponsoring campaigns than narrow interests. When industry-led campaigns occur, they divide along sectoral lines, with industries anticipating benefits arguing in favor of stringent regulations and industries forecast to bear the brunt of such actions sponsoring campaigns in opposition to the proposed rules.

Building on their previous work, @Balla2020 study 22 EPA rules and identify 1,049 "campaigns" on these rules---here, a campaign means a batch of form-letter comments associated with an organization, which Balla et al. code as "regulated" (e.g., a power plant)  or a "regulatory beneficiary" (e.g., environmental groups). They find that the agency was more likely to reference the technical comments that groups submit than form letters. They also find that several types of observed policy changes (e.g., changes in the number of regulated entities and the date that the rule goes into effect) better align with changes requested by sophisticated interest group comments than those found in form letters. They conclude that "legal imperatives trump political considerations in conditioning agency responsiveness, given that mass comment campaigns---relative to other comments---generally contain little 'relevant matter'" [@Balla2020, p. 1].

While @Balla2020 recognize the political nature of public pressure campaigns, they follow many of the administrative law scholars in comparing form letters to sophisticated technical comments. For example, their model compares the number of times the agency references the lengthy comments drafted by the Sierra Club's Legal Team to the number of times the agency references the short form letters drafted by the Sierra Club's Digital Team. In contrast, I argue that we should understand form letters as a tactic aimed at gaining power for coalitions and organizations that also submit sophisticated technical comments. Public pressure is not an alternative to sophisticated lobbying efforts; it is a resource for the broader task of persuading officials to change their policy decisions.


### Incorporating Political Information {#why-mobilize}

<!--MAIN QUESTION -->

How, if at all, should scholars incorporate public pressure into models of bureaucratic policymaking?
I argue that mass engagement produces potentially valuable political information about the coalition that mobilized it. To the extent that groups aim to influence policy, public pressure campaigns support sophisticated lobbying. Scholars should study public pressure as a potential complement, not an alternative to sophisticated lobbying. This means that the role that public pressure may play in policymaking depends on who mobilized it and why. The first step in understanding the potential impact of public pressure is to develop theories and testable hypotheses about the drivers of public participation.  

In this section, I first develop two theories about the drivers of public participation in bureaucratic policymaking, one rooted in theories of group conflict and democratic politics and the other rooted in existing theories of interest-group lobbying in bureaucratic policymaking. I then offer a theory that specifies the conditions under which we should see different kinds of public pressure campaigns. 

#### "Usual Suspects" or "Underdogs"

Existing scholarship points to two possible reasons why agencies may receive millions of public comments. From a conflict expansion perspective, groups that are disadvantaged by the status quo ought to utilize public pressure campaigns. Existing theories of lobbying the bureaucracy suggest that well-resourced and concentrated interests will dominate. 
Political information may thus play two distinct roles in policymaking with opposite effects depending on who mobilized it. The normative and empirical import of public pressure campaigns thus depends on who is behind them. 

<!-- these two paragraphs are somewhat repeated elsewhere. also, need more theory-->
To the extent that well-resourced groups (the "usual suspects") use public pressure campaigns to create a misleading impression of public support (often called "astroturf"), they serve to strengthen and legitimize demands of the same powerful interests that usually dominate bureaucratic policymaking. Here, just as groups with superior resources use them to flood policymakers with technical information [@Wagner2010], astroturf campaigns convert economic resources into political information---an impression of public support generated by signatures or form letters. Even groups with few members or a narrow or non-existent base of support among the public may create the appearance of public support by sponsoring an astroturf campaign. If the powerful business groups that dominate other forms of lobbying also dominate public pressure campaigns, these campaigns (and perhaps public comment periods themselves) are normatively suspect, providing a democratic veneer to economic power. Empirically, we would then expect public pressure campaigns to further advantage the most well-resourced interests. 

The literature on conflict expansion suggests a different possible dynamic. To the extent that less-resourced groups ("underdogs") use public pressure campaigns as a conflict expansion tactic, their role is the opposite: to push back against powerful interests that would otherwise dominate bureaucratic policymaking. The political information created by conflict expansion can reveal existing and potential support among attentive segments of the public. Through public pressure campaigns, groups that lack financial resources can convert latent public support into concrete political information that may cause policymakers to update their beliefs and change their decisions.  

If public pressure campaigns are mainly a vehicle for public interest groups to convert a latent base of public support into influential political information supporting their representational claims or shining light on the policy process, then public comment periods may yet serve some of the informing, balancing, and democratic functions that practitioners and normative theorists desire. Empirically, we would then expect public pressure campaigns to disadvantage well-resourced interests that dominate most policy processes. 


#### The Conditions Under Which Public and Private Interests Mobilize

This section draws on theories of interest group lobbying and conflict expansion to explain variation in mass
engagement. 
First, I offer a framework for assessing the causes of mass engagement.
Next, I argue that organizations may mobilize large numbers of people
for several reasons with observable implications for observed patterns of
public participation.

While most scholars have emphasized the lack of useful technical information in mass comments, a few have raised their role in creating
political information. @Cuellar2005 calls on agencies to pay more
attention to ordinary peoples' expressions of preference. @Rauch2016
suggests that agencies reform the public comment process to include
opinion polls. @Raso2020 suggest a similar reform whereby people could "upvote" comments with which they agree.

I build from a similar intuition that public pressure
campaigns currently function like a poll or, more accurately, a petition, capturing the intensity of preferences among the attentive
public---i.e., how many people are willing to take the time to
engage. Indeed, many campaigns use the language of public opinion and petitioning. For example, a campaign by the World Wildlife Federation provided
    language explicitly claiming to have public opinion on its side.
    Its form letter cited an opinion poll, stating the following: "along with 80 percent of the American
    people, I strongly support ending commercial trade in elephant ivory
    in the U.S." This suggests that public pressure campaigns aim to signal
    information about public opinion.
    A coalition led by another environmental group, Oceana, framed its mass mobilization effort to curb the
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's 2017 Proposed Offshore Oil and Gas
Leasing Program as a "petition signed by 67,275 self-proclaimed United
States residents," suggesting that organizations consider some mass-comment campaigns to effectively be petitions. In the same statement, Oceana also claimed the
support of "more than 110 East Coast municipalities, 100 Members of
Congress, 750 state and local elected officials, and 1,100 business
interests, all of whom oppose offshore drilling," suggesting that demonstrating support from members of the public and elected officials aim to provide similar kinds of
political information.
    
Public pressure campaigns reveal the intensity of passions in attentive segments of the public. Because mass comment campaigns often presage or co-occur with other pressure tactics like protests and lobbying Congress, they may reveal information about other likely political developments.

Building on theories of group conflict in democratic politics, I consider
public demands to be a latent factor in my model of interest group lobbying during bureaucratic policymaking (Figure
\@ref(fig:causal-whymail)). Public demands shape the decisions of
organizations as they choose a lobbying strategy. If they believe a large segment of the attentive public could be rallied to their cause, an organization may attempt to reveal this political information
to policymakers by launching a public pressure campaign. That is, the extent to which latent public demands align with a group's demands will affect its lobbying strategy, specifically whether it decides to launch a public pressure campaign. 


```{r causal-whymail, fig.cap = "Incorporating Political Information into Models of Interest Group Lobbying in Bureaucratic Policymaking"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "causal-direct.png"))
```


Figure \@ref(fig:causal-whymail) amends what I labeled the "classic model" of interest
group lobbying from Figure \@ref(fig:causal-classic) to incorporate political information. In the classic model, lobbying strategies are limited to inside lobbying strategies that aim to persuade officials with legal and technical analysis (`r technical`). In the revised model presented in \@ref(fig:causal-whymail), interest groups may add a second strategy to support their legal and technical arguments with political information (`r mass`). For example, they may sponsor a public pressure campaign that generates political information about the attentive public.  In this case, the organization provides technical information through sophisticated comments and organizes supporters to produce political information about their lobbying coalition through a mass comment campaign. This is a key feature of the theory: political information is mobilized *to support* a lobbying coalition's sophisticated legal or technical lobbying effort, not as an alternative to sophisticated lobbying. 

Interest groups with more latent public support should see a larger public response to a mobilization.
The public
response to the campaign (observed as the scale of public engagement in the policy process) depends on the extent to which the attentive public
is passionate about the issue. A broader and more passionate attentive public will yield a larger volume of mass engagement than a narrower, less passionate base of public support. Thus the observed volume of mass engagement on a given side of a conflict can reveal political information about segments of the public. Broad engagement may produce several types of relevant political
information. The most direct is the expressed "public
opinion" that policymakers observe. I address other types of political information that mass engagement may create in Chapter \@ref(influence). 

The causal process visualized in Figure
\@ref(fig:causal-whymail) may only operate under certain conditions. <!--For example, the success of a mobilizing effort depends on the extent to which a group's perception of latent public demands (the diagonal arrow between "Latent Public Demands" and "Lobbying Strategy") reflects the public response to a mobilizing effort (the horizontal arrow between "Latent Public Demands" and "Mass Engagement"). Additionally, -->
Policymaking institutions have different mechanisms for processing and incorporating technical and political information (the arrows between "Organization provides technical information" or "Organization provides political information" and "Agency officials revise policy"). Agencies may thus have different levels of receptivity to technical and political information. 

Because lobbying organizations likely have some idea of the level of public support for their positions, one observable implication of this model is that lobbying organizations will be more likely to launch a public pressure campaign when they have more public support.

Instead of a public pressure campaign aimed at mobilizing supporters, an organization may attempt to bypass mass engagement by producing fake evidence of public support. However, as I describe below, this is a risky strategy. 



### Types of Pressure Campaign Motivations

The potential effects of public pressure campaigns depend, in part, on the aims of a
campaign. Campaigns may pursue two distinct aims: (1) to advance policy goals or (2) to satisfy some audience other than policymakers (e.g., potential members or donors). Within each goal, campaigns can be further distinguished by whether their side is more likely to  benefit or be harmed by an expansion of the conflict. Some groups have incentives to pursue policy goals by *proactively* launching a campaign, i.e., by "going public." Others only have incentives to launch a campaign *reactively* after some other group has already expanded the scope of conflict. When groups aim to satisfy audiences other than policymakers and expect to win the policy conflict, campaigns are a form of *credit claiming.* Conversely, when a group anticipates losing the particular policy fight but still sees benefits in launching a campaign targeting non-policymaker audiences. I call this *going down fighting.* Proactively going public and reactively mobilizing after the other side has expanded the scope of conflict forms of outside lobbying. Credit claiming and going down fighting describe
situations where an organization mobilizes for reasons other than influencing the policy at hand, like engaging or recruiting members. 


**Proactive campaigns.** Coalitions "go public" when they believe that
expanding the scope of conflict gives them an advantage. Because coalitions that "go public" should believe they have more intense public
support, mass engagement is likely to skew heavily toward this side.

Going public is likely to be used by those who would be disadvantaged (those
    @Schattschneider1975 calls the 'losers') in a policy process with
    less public attention.
More people may also be inspired indirectly (e.g., through news stories) or
to engage with more effort (e.g., writing longer public comments) than people
mobilized by the side with less public support. This is important
because political information may be especially influential if
decisionmakers perceive a consensus. The level of consensus among interest groups
    [@Golden1998; @Yackee2006JPART], especially business unity
    [@Yackee2006JOP; @Haeder2015], predicts policy change.^[It is not clear if the power of coalition unity is a result of strategic calculation by policymakers, a perceived obligation due to the normative power of consensus (e.g., following a majoritarian logic [@Dahl1989; @Mendelson2011]), or simply that unified demands are easier to process than opposing demands.]



**Reactive campaigns.** I theorize that when coalitions
with less public support mobilize, it is a reaction to their opponents.
Because the impression of consensus is potentially powerful, when one coalition goes
public, an opposing coalition may countermobilize to emphasize that "both sides" have support from the broader public. Because these are coalitions with less intense public support, I expect such campaigns to engage
fewer people.
In the extreme, these campaigns may rely on various forms of deception (i.e., astroturf campaigns) to compensate for their disadvantage in genuine public support.



**Credit claiming** and **going down fighting**. Finally, campaigns may target audiences other than policymakers. When they expect to win, organizations may launch a "credit claiming" campaign to draw attention to and associate their organization with positive policy developments.  When they expect to lose, organizations may "go down fighting" to fulfill
supporters' expectations. These more performative reasons for organizing a campaign may help engage existing supporters and recruit new members.  For example, @CarpenterPetitions finds that many anti-slavery petitions were this type of campaign, where "the most important readers of a
petition are its signatories" rather than the policymakers to whom they are addressed. 

```{r sierra, out.width="60%",fig.cap = "The Sierra Club Collects Contact Information Through Public Pressure Campaigns"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "sierra2.jpeg"))
```

Credit claiming and going down fighting
campaigns may target member retention or recruitment, fundraising, or satisfying a
board of directors. For example, as Figure \@ref(fig:sierra) shows, the Sierra Club uses campaigns to collect
contact information of supporters and potential members. Given the executive-branch transition between 2010, when the rule was
initiated, and 2017 when it was delayed, the Sierra Club likely saw
little hope of protecting methane pollution standards in 2017. Still, for members
of the public who wanted to voice their opinion to the Trump administration, the Sierra Club created
an easy way to do so, as long as users consented to "receive periodic
communication from the Sierra Club." While this campaign may have had little hope of influencing these particular policies, it may have increased awareness of air pollution and built contact lists that could help the Sierra Club fundraise and mobilize in future policy fights. 

While "credit claiming" and "going down fighting"  are unlikely to have immediate policy effects, they may affect future policies. Because interest groups and agencies both expect to "repeat endlessly" the policymaking process [@Lindblom1968], power built or demonstrated in one policy process may also be a political resource in future policy fights. 
Through repeated interactions, organizations build power with respect to a constituency [@Han2014] and policymakers [@Grossmann2012]. First, building contact lists or potential donors and supporters are a resource for future policy fights. Political support for a policy may depend on actors’ experiences with previous policies and their perceived relationship to the policy in question [@Weir1989]. "Going down fighting" may be a particularly effective strategy in building awareness and power for future fights. In interviews with mobilizing organizations like the Sierra Club, @Han2014 finds that repeated engagement through a mix of online and in-person organizing can transform participants' motivations and capacities for involvement.  By building the capacities and motivations of their members and supporters, organizations increase their own capacity for future policy fights.  For example, if one administration makes a policy that a large segment of the public can be mobilized to oppose, it may help organizations put the repeal of that policy on the agenda of the next administration. 

Second, mobilizing in one policy fight helps organizations build a reputation among policymakers. A reputation for organizing public pressure campaigns may create an implicit credible threat that the organization may expand the scope of conflict. 
Organizations that mobilize members and create a long-lasting presence in Washington become, in the minds of policymakers and reporters, the taken-for-granted surrogates for these public groups [@Grossmann2012].


While more performative or power-building campaigns may engage many people, they are unlikely to inspire countermobilization. 
To the extent that public interest organizations
mobilize for reasons other than influencing policy, opposing private interest groups
with less public support have little reason to countermobilize. The reverse is not true. Private interest groups ought to only launch campaigns when the policy is in play. In these cases, public interest groups also have incentives to mobilize. Thus, member-funded public interest groups should be more common than campaigns sponsored by narrow private interests, simply because they have more occasions in which mobilizing has benefits. Campaigns sponsored by narrow private interests should occur in opposition to another campaign, but public interest groups have reasons to launch a campaign even when policy is unlikely to move.

Put differently, broader (often public) interest groups often have incentives to mobilize *proactively* when policy could be affected by expanding the scope of conflict. Where the policy is not in play, they may still benefit from credit claiming or going down fighting. Therefore public interest groups will often want to mobilize. In contrast, narrow (often private) interest groups do not benefit from expanding the scope of conflict and should thus only mobilize pressure campaigns *reactively*. Nor do they have audiences like members and donors that create performative reasons for mobilizing a pressure campaign.

In many cases, going public as a lobbying strategy is simultaneously an opportunity to engage and recruit members. Organizations often go public in order to influence policy and engage in power-building tactics at the same time. For example, the Sierra Club organized several "Thank you, EPA" campaigns, asking supporters to thank the Obama EPA for new draft environmental policies and urge the agency not to back down. These campaigns simultaneously (1) engaged members, (2) implied that the Sierra Club had advanced its policy agenda (implicit credit claiming), and (3) pressured policymakers to hold their course or strengthen policy rather than bend to industry pressures.


The extent to which a campaign genuinely aims to influence policy or is pursuing other logics may be difficult to distinguish in
the observed public response. Indeed, multiple motivations may drive most campaigns, and members of the public may poorly
understand the different chances of success in each case. 
However, lobbying organizations likely know their chances of success and should
thus invest less in providing technical information when they see little opportunity to affect policy. By identifying cases where coalitions engage in large
public campaigns without corresponding investment in technical information, we may be able to assess whether countermobilization is indeed less
likely in these cases.

### Hypotheses About the Drivers of Mass Mobilization

The observable implications of the theory described above suggest several testable hypotheses. 

First, public comments will differ in several ways depending on whether most public participation is individuals acting alone or organized and mediated through organizations their pressure campaigns. 
The solicitation on regulations.gov---"Let your voice be heard"---suggests that individuals are expressing themselves directly. Indeed, anyone can write a letter or type a comment in the text box on regulations.gov, and many people do. Individuals acting on their own submit content ranging from obscenities and memes to detailed personal accounts of how a policy would affect them and even poetry aimed at changing officials' hearts and minds. 
Comments submitted by individuals acting alone should not have a large share of text copied from elsewhere. They should not reference an organization or be mailed or uploaded in bulk by an organization.

In contrast, to the extent that participation is mediated through public pressure campaigns, as my theory suggests, public commenting should show signs of "cooperative activity." Comments from people who were mobilized as part of a campaign differ from those of individuals acting on their own in two observable ways: First, they often mention the name of the organization that mobilized them. Second, the text is often similar or identical to other comments in the campaign, reflecting coordination through form or template letters. These features eliminate the novel informational value that  @Cuellar2005 and others seek to locate in individual comments. If comments reference an organization that mobilized them, they likely have little more to offer than what the more sophisticated organization has already provided. If comments are identical, they certainly provide no new technical information.

While observers frequently talk about ordinary people engaging in policymaking as individuals, political science theory suggests that an organized group will almost always mediate the participation of individuals who are not professional policy influencers. Political science has shown that national politics in the United States is the terrain of organized groups. Given the technocratic nature of bureaucratic policymaking, "citizen-initiated contacts" should be especially rare.

<!--1-->
```{hypothesis, meditated, echo = TRUE}
Most people engage in national policy processes as a result of organized public pressure campaigns.
```

From a behavioral perspective, Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:meditated) posits that individuals are more likely to engage in behaviors like letter-writing and petition-signing as part of coordinated and cooperative activity. The barriers to individual participation make "citizen-initiated contacts" on matters of national policy relatively rare. Organized campaigns overcome these barriers by informing, motivating, and reducing the costs of participation.


<!--2-->
Second, I argue that public pressure tactics complement rather than substitute for sophisticated technical lobbying. Whereas previous studies compare mass comment campaigns to technical lobbying efforts, I argue that the relevant unit of analysis is the lobbying coalition. Coalitions may use both sophisticated technical lobbying and public pressure tactics. 

<!--TODO DAVE: CLARIFY LOGIC-->

```{hypothesis, coalitions, echo = TRUE}
Public pressure campaigns are organized by *coalitions* that include groups that engage in sophisticated technical lobbying.
```

From a behavioral perspective, Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:coalitions) posits that decisionmakers in lobbying organizations do not confront a choice of whether to pursue an inside or outside strategy; it is a choice between an inside strategy (the norm) or *both* an inside and outside strategy because public pressure campaigns lend political support to more sophisticated legal and technical arguments for specific policy changes. 

Testing Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:coalitions) requires that we group organizations into lobbying coalitions. It predicts that coalitions that use public pressure campaigns also include groups that engage in sophisticated lobbying. To the extent that coalitions using outside strategies do not also use inside strategies would be evidence against Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:coalitions).

<!--3-->
Third, while lobbying coalitions may form around various material and ideological
conflicts, public interest groups are more likely to be advantaged by going public, credit claiming, or going
down fighting, because they are organizations primarily
serving a broad idea of the public good rather than the narrow material interests of
their members. Indeed, @Potter2017 finds that advocacy group-driven campaigns mobilize
far more people on average than industry-driven campaigns on EPA rules. 

<!-- TODO revise these two paragraphs-->
Building on @Lowi1969 and @Wilson1989, I theorize that mass mobilization is more
likely to occur in conflicts of public versus private interests or
public versus public interests (i.e., between coalitions led by groups
with distinct cultural ideals or desired public goods), provided they
have sufficient resources to run a campaign. If true, one implication is
that mass mobilization will systematically run counter to concentrated
business interests where they conflict with the values of public
interest groups with sufficient resources to mobilize.

When policy conflicts pit broad public interests against narrower private interests, the public interest groups more often have incentives to launch public pressure campaigns, both for policy and organizational reasons. Because outside lobbying can alter the decision environment, those who have the advantage in the usual rulemaking process (where a more limited set of actors participate) have little incentive to expand the scope of the conflict. Additionally, I argue, public interest groups have greater incentives than businesses to launch public pressure campaigns for reasons other than influencing policy. Both policy and non-policy reasons to launch a campaign suggest that public interest groups will use outside strategies more often. 

<!--4-->
```{hypothesis, public, echo = TRUE}
Public interest group coalitions sponsor public pressure campaigns *more often* than private interest group (e.g., business-led) coalitions.
```

Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:public) may be evaluated in absolute terms--whether most public pressure campaigns are launched by public interest groups---or relative terms---whether public interest groups are more likely to use public pressure campaigns when they lobby than private interests are. 

The
inverse could also be true. Business groups that are
already advantaged in the policy process may leverage
their superior resources to further mobilize support or bolster claims that they represent more than their private
interest. If mobilization most often takes this form, this
would be evidence against Hypothesis
\@ref(hyp:public) and Schattschneider's argument that it is the
disadvantaged who seek to expand the scope of the conflict.



Fifth, if the success of a mobilization effort is moderated
by latent public support, as my theory asserts, broader public interest group coalitions ought to
mobilize more people for a given level of mobilization effort (e.g., spending or solicitations). That is, the scale and the intensity of public engagement depend on preexisting support for the proposition that people are being asked to support, and public interest groups more often have broad public support than narrow private interests. 

<!--5-->
```{hypothesis, public-success, echo = TRUE}
Public interest group coalitions have a larger response to their mobilizing efforts than private interest group (e.g., business-led) coalitions. 
```


From a behavioral perspective, Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:public-success) suggests that the average person is more easily mobilized to sign a form letter from a public interest group than a private interest group. 


<!--6-->
Notwithstanding the incentive structure that should lead coalitions advancing broad public interests to mobilize public support more often and more successfully than narrow private interests, resources and capacity are still necessary conditions to run a campaign. Most organizations that are
disadvantaged in the policy process also lack resources to launch
mass mobilization campaigns. This means that public pressure tactics are only an option for a small subset of large public interest organizations. 

Mobilizing people for a particular policy fight requires a significant organizing capacity. @McNutt2007 calls these formations "policy change organizations." In contrast to membership organizations, they exist more to organize public pressure toward a set of policy goals than to serve a defined membership.
<!-- TODO: Discuss resources in  mobilization section -->

```{hypothesis, resources, echo = TRUE}
Public pressure campaigns targeting national policy are most often run by large national policy advocacy organizations.
```

If instead, lay commenters are mobilized through their membership organizations, as @Kerwin2011 suggest, a large campaign of, say, one million people would generally require a large collection of membership organizations. Very few organizations have a million members. Those that do are unlikely to mobilize all of them, so mobilizing many people through membership organizations would likely require a large coalition of membership organizations. We would expect commenters to identify themselves as members of these many organizations.

<!--6-->
Finally, if the theory of conflict expansion posited by @Schattschneider1975 is correct, narrow private interests only have incentives to mobilize public support to counteract an opposing campaign.
If private interest groups like businesses primarily use public pressure campaigns *reactively* to counter a message of public consensus advanced by an opposing lobbying coalition, we should rarely see private interest groups lobbying unopposed. 

<!--only a handful of studies consider either how the presence of opposition from organizations and government officials (Hojnacki 1997, 1998; Holyoke 2003; Holyoke et al. 2007; Mahoney 2008; Baumgartner et al. 2009)-->

```{hypothesis, disrupt, echo = TRUE}
If narrow private interest groups (e.g., businesses) launch public pressure campaigns, it is a response to an opposing campaign. 
```

Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:disrupt) would be supported by evidence that public interest group coalitions more often lobby unopposed than private interest groups.

The next section outlines the data and methods I use to evaluate these hypotheses.
