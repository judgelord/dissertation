### Forms and Drivers of Civic Participation 

Civic engagement includes participation in letter-writing campaigns, petitions, protests, hearings [@Verba1987]. Importantly, @Verba1987 distinguish "citizen-initiated contacts" from "cooperative activity" (pg. 54). Cooperative activities are coordinated and mediated through an organization.

> TODO: MORE ON GROUP MEDIATION

Forms of civic participation beyond voting, such as protests and petitioning, offer unique opportunities for minority interests. @Gillion2013 finds protests to be an effective mechanism for minority interests to communicate preferences to policymakers when electoral mechanisms fail to do so. Gillion finds that policymakers learn and take informational cues from political behaviors like protests. @CarpenterPetitions finds similar potential in petitions: "Petition democracy offer another model of aggregation, where numerical minorities could still make a case of quantitive relevance" (pg. 479). Numbers matter for protests and, especially, petitions, regardless of whether they represent a majority. 

### The Role of Interest Groups 

Interest groups play a critical role in American politics. 

Mobilizing citizens and generating new political information are key functions of interest groups in a democracy [@Mansbridge1992; @Mahoney2007].

#### Membership Organizations

> "The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees ("AFSCME") represents 1.6 million state and local government, health care and child care workers and we write to express our strong support of the proposed rule" ([IRS-2016-0015-0133](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/IRS-2016-0015-0133))

Some membership organizations are federations.  

> "The Coalition on Human Needs, which represents more than 100 national member organizations and maintains a network of tens of thousands of individuals and groups nationwide, strongly supports the proposed rule" ([IRS-2016-0015-0131](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/IRS-2016-0015-0131))

Organizations often claim to represent more than their membership.

> "As a leading representative of the nation's 28 million small business owners, Small Business Majority is writing to comment on the U.S. Department of the Treasury's proposed rule on Inversions and Related Transactions." ([IRS-2016-0015-0127](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/IRS-2016-0015-0127))




#### Advocacy Organizations


> TODO pressure groups, policy advocacy groups, citizen groups [@Berry1999], policy change organizations [McNutt2005], petitions [@CarpenterPetitions]

Organizations may use phone banks, targeting strategies,
    and direct-mail techniques to drum up and channel public support
    (Cooper 1985)
    
Advocacy organizations work together on campaigns. For example, "Save our Environment," which mobilized a quarter-million comments on one rule, is a 501c3 nonprofit with a simple WordPress website run by The Partnership Project, a coalition of 20 of the largest environmental advocacy organizations in the US, including the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, Greenpeace, and the World Wildlife Fund. Several Partnership project members, including the Sierra Club, EarthJustice, and NRDC, also mobilized hundreds of thousands of their own supporters.
    
<!-- move below to methods?---> 
    
Advocacy organizations often claim to represent a large number of "members and supporters" (FWS-HQ-ES-2018-0007-47165](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/FWS-HQ-ES-2018-0007-47165))

For example, in comments on regulations regulating internet gambling, the Poker Players Alliance claimed to represent "more than 840,000 poker enthusiast members" (TREAS-DO-2007-0015-0118). Many of these "members" were recruited when they signed up to play a free online poker game, but the organization did claim to have mobilized over 150,000 letters to members of Congress, which, if true, would indicate a somewhat active membership. 
The potential for "cheap talk" in claims of representation is a problem for the ability of groups to communicate credible political information.

To mobilized broader support, advocacy organizations often engage smaller organizations to mobilize their members as well. For example, in a public pressure campaign targeting fishing regulations, in addition to mobilizing thousands of individuals, the Pew Charitable Trusts mobilized members of the New York Underwater Photography Society and hundreds of restaurants that serve sustainable seafood. These smaller did not identify themselves as part of Pew's campaign, but their letters used almost identical language.

@Potter2017 finds that advocacy group-driven campaigns mobilize
far more people on average than industry-driven campaigns. 

### Group Conflict in Democratic Theory 

> TODO @Dahl1985, @Schattschneider1975, @Kollman1998

### Theories of Bureaucratic Policymaking

The contentious politics that inspire most public engagement in policymaking have no place in leading models of bureaucratic policymaking and have largely been ignored by political scientists.
Foundational scholarship on rulemaking [@Furlong2005, @Furlong1997, @Furlong1998, @Kerwin2011] focuses on interest group lobbying. Theoretical models focus on how agencies learn about policy problems, negotiate or avoid accountability to various principals, or balance interest-group demands.^[On learning, see @Kerwin2011 and empirical studies by @Yackee2012,
    @Cook2017, @Gordon2018, and @Walters2019. See @Gailmard2017 and
    @Libgober2018 for information-based models where comments reveal information to the agency.
    On accountability to elected officials, see @Furlong1997, @Nou2016,
    @Potter2016, @Woods2018, and @Yackee2009RegGov. 
    @Potter2014dis develops a signaling model where agencies propose and principals veto rules depending, in part, on their beliefs about interest group preferences.
    On interest-group balancing, see @Yackee2006JOP, @Yackee2006JPART,
    and @Kerwin2011. A key assumption of Libgober's (2018) model is that
    bureaucrats have a distribution of preferences over interest group
    positions, about which they are uncertain unless groups reveal their
    preferences through commenting.]

<!--Most scholars are skeptical that public pressure can affect rulemaking.-->

To the extent that scholars address the input of ordinary people at all, both
existing theory and empirical scholarship suggest skepticism that non-sophisticated actors matter. (By "ordinary" people, I simply mean people who are not
professional policy influencers.)
Empirical scholarship finds that economic elites and business groups
dominate American politics in general [@Jacobs2005,@Soss2007, Hertel-Fernandez2019, @Hacker2003, @Gilens2014] and rulemaking in
particular. While some are optimistic that requirements for agencies to
solicit and respond to public comments on proposed rules allow "civil
society" to provide public oversight [@Michaels2015; @Metzger2010], most
studies find that participants in rulemaking often represent elites and
business interests [@Seifter2016UCLA; @Crow2015; @Wagner2011; @West2009; @Yackee2006JOP; @Yackee2006JPART; @Golden1998; @Haeder2015; @Cook2017, LibgoberCarpenter2018].
<!--
From a strategic perspective, agency officials are not directly
accountable to voters. And even if organized groups do supplement
congressional and judicial checks on executive power, the groups that
participate in rulemaking represent only certain (if any) segments of
the public and may not represent them well [@Seifter2016UCLA].-->

Because scholars are skeptical about rulemaking as a venue for collective action, most dismiss public pressure campaigns as epiphenomenal to bargaining with political principals
or interest groups. Indeed, almost all empirical studies of rulemaking
discard unsophisticated comments from ordinary people, as evident from a
comprehensive review of scholarship on "The Politics of Rulemaking" by
@Yackee2019, who finds skepticism about citizen comments, but no studies
analyzing public pressure campaigns as a lobbying tactic:

> "@Kerwin2011 point out that a citizen must know not only that a regulation is being formulated but also how and when to participate. This is a high bar for most Americans. Second, to be influential during rulemaking, commenters may require resources and technical expertise. As @Epstein2014 suggest, agency rule-writers---who are often chosen because of their technical or policy-specific expertise---privilege the type of data-driven arguments and reasoning
that are not common to citizen comments." (p. 10)

For any particular lay commenter, this conclusion seems inescapable; individuals acting alone are unlikely to affect policy. As Hacker and Pierson (Forthcoming) observe, 

>"[The United States'] institutional terrain advantages political actors with the capacity to work across multiple venues, over extended periods, and in a political environment where coordinated government action is difficult, and strategies of evasion and exit from regulatory constraints are often successful. These capacities are characteristic of organized groups, not individual voters."

<!--PUSZZEL (AGAIN?) -->
But groups occasionally mobilize a large number of people, usually behind a more sophisticated lobbying effort. Without a systematic understanding of the scale and impact of public participation--*group-mediated* participation--in rulemaking, it is impossible to answer normative questions about how participatory processes like public comment periods may enhance or undermine various democratic ideals.
<!--These bursts of civic participation may affect
rulemaking [@Coglianese2001], but **this intuition has yet to be tested.**-->

Scholars' neglect of public pressure campaigns is surprising given that most people are only
aware of agency rulemaking when it is the target of a high-profile mass
mobilization campaign.^[Some of the most contentious recent public controversies involve bureaucratic policymaking. For example, along with 50 thousand
    protesters in Washington D.C., the State Department Received 1.2
    million comments on the Environmental Impact Statement for the
    Keystone Pipeline. Similarly, along with the thousands of protesters
    supporting the Standing Rock Sioux protest to the Dakota Access
    Pipeline, the Army Corps of Engineers received hundreds of thousands of comments. Alongside protest actions that included shutting down many websites, the Federal Communications Commission's open internet rule received 22 million comments. While some of these comments appear to be fake, the scale of public engagement is remarkable given how little attention political scientists have paid to it.
    Fake public comments also raise the question of why an organization
    would bother to generate fake public input if it did not matter, as
    its omission from theories of bureaucratic policymaking would seem
    to imply.] While most rules receive little attention,
the ease of online mobilizing and commenting has, like other forms of
participation [@Boulianne2018], created exponential increases in the
number of rules in which thousands and even millions of people engage
(see Figure \@ref(fig:comments-per-year); note that comments per rule are on a
logarithmic scale).^[Proposed rules that have attracted the most public attention have
    been published by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC,
    omitted from this plot), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
    the Department of Interior (DOI), the Bureau of Ocean Energy
    Management (BOEM), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB),
    and Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).] Occasionally, a large number of people are
paying attention. <!--These bursts of civic participation may affect
rulemaking [@Coglianese2001], but this intuition has yet to be tested.-->



The general failure to explain or account for public pressure campaigns in models of bureaucratic policymaking is also striking in light of how agencies advertise public
comment periods as an opportunity for a voice in government
decisions.^[I focus on public comments in rulemaking, but the theories and methods here may also apply to other kinds of political engagement such as through social media or protests as well as to other political decisions, including state-level rulemaking. Social media
    engagement may be especially important if agencies implement the
    recommendations of @ACUS2018 that "Agencies should consider using
    social media before or in connection with direct final rulemaking to
    quickly identify whether there are significant or meaningful
    objections" (p. 34).] Big red letters across the top of the Regulations.gov
homepage solicit visitors to "Make a difference. Submit your comments
and let your voice be heard" and "Participate today!" (Figure \@ref(fig:regsgov). A blue "Comment Now!" button accompanies a short description of each draft
policy and pending agency action. 
Public comment periods on proposed agency
rules are described as "an important part of democracy" (WSJ 2017),
"often held out as the purest example of participatory democracy in
actual American governance" [@Herz2016]. @Rossi1997 finds that "courts, Congress, and scholars have elevated participation in rulemaking to
a sacrosanct status...greater participation is generally viewed as
contributing to democracy."

```


<!-- now in influence 01:-->
While "ordinary" members of the public may occasionally provide novel
and useful technical information to expert bureaucrats, such
sophisticated means of influencing policy are out of reach for the vast
majority of people. Thus, to investigate the potential role of ordinary
people in bureaucratic politics I look elsewhere---not because ordinary
people never provide novel and useful technical information, but because
this is not how most people attempt to influence policy, nor, I argue,
how we should expect ordinary people to have influence.

Most public comments are, in fact, of the type suggested by the
solicitations on Regulations.gov---ordinary people voicing opinions on a proposed policy. They do not provide useful technical information or
suggest specific edits to policy texts like the interest group comments
that have thus far captured the attention of political scientists. If
they add information to rulemaking, it is a different, more political
flavor of information. Indeed as Figure
\@ref(fig:comments-per-year) shows, every year since 2008, most people who
comment on draft regulations have done so as a result of a public pressure campaign.^[At least for agencies participating in regulations.gov. See
    sections
    \@ref(why-methods) and
    \@ref(why-results) for my definition and methods for identifying mass comments.] Public engagement in rulemaking is highly
clustered on a few rules made salient by these campaigns. It is
plausible that at least some of the time, such campaigns aim to
influence policy. It is also plausible that thousands of people engaging
may alter the politics of these policy processes, but this hypothesis
remains untested. Indeed, we have much to understand about the causes
and effects of these campaigns before we are in a position to ask if
they are a mechanism for groups to influence policy. Most critically, we
must understand who mobilizes and why.

<!--/now in influence 01-->

The kind of politics created by mass engagement has a few notable
features. It is contentious; most ordinary people are not engaging in
deliberation; they are simply making demands. Importantly, however,
processes like public comment periods channel contentious demands into
institutionalized policy processes rather than undermining them. In
short, the politics of rulemaking created by public pressure campaigns is much
more contentious than most rulemakings but also much more
institutionalized than most contentious politics. Mass engagement in
rulemaking thus presents a novel context to examine the consequences of
broader public participation in typically insider-dominated policymaking and how
public pressure may condition how political decisions are made.

Public pressure campaigns expand civic participation in policymaking.^[If we define "civic participation" as "acts aimed at influencing governmental decisions [@Verba1987 p. 2], signing a petition or form comment counts. However, some consider true
participation to be deliberative, which mass comment campaigns are not.<!--@Goodin2006-->
Other criteria posed by normative theorists that participation should be "genuine," "informed," or "reasoned" are more difficult to assess. Normative theorists may debate whether deliberation among a small number of people is preferable to a large number of people simply expressing their preferences, but empirically, public participation in bureaucratic policymaking is much more the latter [@Shapiro2008b].]
Surely, those who engage are far from representative of the broader public [@Verba1987], but in many ways, they must be more representative than the handful of political insiders who participate in most policy processes. 

If the usual participants have "an upper-class accent" [@Schattschneider1942], does adding thousands of more voices dilute this bias? I argue that the answer depends on how people are mobilized. If public pressure is mobilized by the usual participants to create an impression of public support, it may merely legitimize the demands of powerful interest groups. 

### Incorporating Political Information {#why-mobilize}

<!--% MAIN QUESTION 
### Incorporating mass engagement into theories of bureaucratic policymaking.--> 



How, if at all, should scholars incorporate mass engagement into models of bureaucratic policymaking? 

In this section, I first develop two theories about the drivers of public participation in bureaucratic policymaking, one rooted in theories of group conflict and democratic politics and the other rooted in existing theories of interest-group lobbying in bureaucratic policymaking. I then offer a synthetic theory that specifies the conditions under which we should see different kinds of public pressure campaigns. 

#### The "Ususal Suspects" or "Underdogs"

I argue that mass engagement produces potentially valuable political information about the coalition that mobilized it. Political information may play two distinct roles in policymaking with opposite effects depending on who mobilized it. The normative and empirical import of public pressure campaigns thus turns on who is behind them. 

To the extent that well-resourced groups (the "usual suspects") use public pressure campaigns to create a misleading impression of public support (often called "astroturf"), their role is to strengthen and legitimize demands of the same powerful interests that dominate bureaucratic policymaking. Here, just as groups with superior resources use them to flood policymakers with technical information [@Wagner2010], astroturf campaigns convert economic resources into political information in the form of an impression of public support generated by signatures or form letters. Even groups with few members or a narrow or non-existent base of support among the public may create the appearance of public support by sponsoring pressure campaigns. If the powerful business groups that dominate other forms of lobbying also dominate public pressure campaigns, these campaigns (and perhaps public comment periods themselves) are normatively suspect, merely providing a democratic veneer to economic power. Empirically, we would then expect public pressure campaigns to further advantage well-resourced interests. 

Alternatively, to the extent that public interest groups use public pressure campaigns are used as conflict expansion tactics by less-resourced groups ("underdogs"), their role is the opposite: to push back against powerful interests that dominate bureaucratic policymaking. The political information created by conflict expansion can reveal existing and potential support among attentive segments of the public. Through public pressure campaigns, groups that lack financial resources can convert latent public support into concrete political information that may cause policymakers to update their beliefs and change their behavior.  
If mass commenting is mainly a vehicle for public interest groups to convert a latent base of public support into influential political information supporting their representational claims, public comment periods may yet serve some of informing, balancing, and democratic functions that practitioners and normative theorists hoped they would. Empirically, we would then expect public pressure campaigns to disadvantage well-resourced interests that dominate most policy processes.

The next section builds a causal theory. I theorize that activists' opportunities and strategies and latent public opinion drive engagement.

% The following section outlines methodologies to assess my three overarching questions and their component parts. These methods rely on analysis of comment and policy texts as large-n observational data. -->


This section offers a synthesis of theory on interest group lobbying and conflict expansion and hypotheses to explain variation in mass
engagement. 




As noted above, scholars of bureaucratic policymaking have focused on
the sophisticated lobbying efforts of powerful interest groups such as
business coalitions. A key insight from this scholarship is that
technical information is the currency of insider lobbying. Figure
\@ref(fig:causal-classic) illustrates the classic causal
model of insider lobbying that describes most rulemakings and nearly all
scholarship on lobbying in bureaucratic policymaking to date.^[Diamonds indicate observable choices, ovals indicate latent preferences and rectangles indicate information.]
However, mass engagement has no place in this model. I aim to fill this
gap.

```{r causal-classic, fig.cap = "The 'Classic Model' of Interest Group Lobbying in Bureaucratic Policymaking"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "causal-classic.png"))
```

First, I offer a framework for assessing the causes of mass engagement.
Next, I argue that organizations may mobilize large numbers of people
for three reasons with observable implications for observed patterns of
mass engagement and theoretical implications for predicted effects on
policy.



<!-- in 01-influence: -->
#### Public Pressure as a Resource

An organization's ability to expand the scope of conflict by mobilizing
a large number of people can be a valuable political resource [@Schattschneider1975]. In contrast to scholars who focus on the deliberative
potential of public comment processes, I focus on public engagement as a
tactic aimed at gaining power. Scholars who understand mobilization
as a tactic [@Furlong1997; @Kerwin2011] have focused on how
organizations mobilize their membership. I expand on this understanding of mobilization as a lobbying tactic to include a campaign's broader audience, more akin to the concept of
an attentive public [@Key1961] or issue public [@Converse1964].

Here I build on three insights. First, @Furlong1997 and @Kerwin2011
identify mobilization as a tactic. The organizations that they surveyed
reported that forming coalitions and mobilizing large numbers of people
are among the most effective lobbying tactics. Second, @Nelson2012
identify political information as a potentially influential result of
lobbying by different business coalitions. While they focus on
mobilizing experts, I argue that @Nelson2012 describe a dynamic that can be extended
to public pressure campaigns:

> "strategic recruitment, we theorize, mobilizes new actors to participate in the policymaking process, bringing with them novel technical and political information. In other words, when an expanded strategy is employed, leaders activate individuals and organizations to participate in the policymaking process who, without the coordinating efforts of the leaders, would otherwise not lobby. This activation is important because it implies that coalition lobbying can generate new information and new actors---beyond simply the 'usual suspects'---relevant to policy decisionmakers."

Concerning political information, this logic extends to
non-experts. The number and distribution of ordinary supporters may
matter because it suggests a *public* consensus. Instead of bolstering
*scientific* claims, a perceived public consensus bolsters *political*
claims. To understand how groups
lobby in rulemaking, we must understand mass mobilization as a tactic
aimed at producing political information.

While most scholars have emphasized the lack of useful technical information in mass comments, a few have raised their role in creating
political information. @Cuellar2005 calls on agencies to pay more
attention to ordinary peoples' expressions of preference and @Rauch2016
suggests that agencies reform the public comment process to include
opinion polls. 

I build from a similar intuition that public pressure
campaigns currently function like a poll or, more accurately, a petition, capturing the intensity of preferences among the attentive
public---i.e., how many people are willing to take the time to
engage. For example, a campaign by the World Wildlife Federation provided
    language explicitly claiming to have public opinion on their side.
    Their model comment cited an opinion poll, stating that "Along with 80% of the American
    people, I strongly support ending commercial trade in elephant ivory
    in the U.S." This suggests that mass comment campaigns aim to signal
    information about public opinion.
    

Self-selection may not be ideal for representation, but
opt-in participation---whether voting, attending a hearing, or writing a
comment---may often be one of the few heuristics decisionmakers have
about public preferences.

Mobilizing citizens and generating new political information are key functions of interest groups in a democracy
[@Mansbridge1992; @Mahoney2007]. Petitioning, in particular, is a mechanism of raising "new claims" [@CarpenterPetitions]. Campaigns inform agencies about the
distribution and intensity of opinions that are often too nuanced to
estimate a priori. However limited and slanted, this information is directed at decisionmakers who may often be unclear how the public and other political institutions will react. Many questions that arise in rulemaking lack
analogous public opinion polling questions, making mass commenting a
unique source of political information. As with public opinion on any
specific policy issues, most members of the public and their elected
representatives may only learn about the issue and take a position as a
result of a public pressure campaign [@Hutchings2003]. I thus consider
public demands to be a latent factor in my model of policymaking (Figure
\@ref(fig:causal-whymail). Public demands shape the decisions of
groups who lobby in rulemaking. If they believe the attentive public is
on their side, groups may attempt to reveal this political information
to policymakers by launching a mass mobilization campaign. The public
response to the campaign depends on the extent that the attentive public
is passionate about the issue.

```{r causal-whymail, fig.cap = "Incorporating Political Information into Models of Bureaucratic Policymaking"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "causal-whymail.png"))

```

Figure \@ref(fig:causal-whymail) amends the "Classic Model" of interest
group lobbying (Figure \@ref(fig:causal-classic)) to incorporate political information about the attentive public. In addition to providing technical information through sophisticated comments, an organization may mobilize supporters.
The more latent public support a group has, the more successful this mobilization effort will be. Because lobbying organizations likely have some idea of the level of public support for their positions, the observable implication of this is that groups will choose to mobilize either when they have a good deal of public support (where public support is a resource) or the resources to compensate for a tepid response to their campaign (in the case of astroturf campaigns). 
Large-scale engagement may produce several types of relevant political
information. The most direct and obvious is the expressed "public
opinion" that policymakers observe.^[I address other types of political information that mass engagement may create elsewhere. For an expanded model, see Figure
    \@ref(fig:causal-full). 
]

The causal process visualized in Figure
\@ref(fig:causal-whymail) may only operate under certain conditions. The success of a mobilizing effort depends on whether a group's perception of latent public demands (the diagonal arrow between "Latent Public Demands" and "Lobbying Strategy") reflects the public response to a mobilizing effort (the horizontal arrow between "Latent Public Demands" and "Mass Engagement"). 

<!-- / in 01-influence -->



#### Second-order Representation

When lobbying during rulemaking, groups often
make dubious claims to represent broad segments of the public
[@Seifter2016UCLA]. If agency staff do not trust an organizations'
representational claims, engaging actual people may be one of the few
credible signals of a broad base of support.  Furthermore, if
organizations claim to represent people beyond their official members,
reforms requiring groups to disclose information about their funding and
membership [@Seifter2016UCLA] only go part way to assess groups' claims
to represent these broader segments of the public.^[For example, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a top mobilizer of public comments, often claims to represent "3 million members
and online activists" (https://www.nrdc.org/about), presumably including anyone who has donated to or participated in one of its campaigns. Mobilizing comments is one way that NRDC can demonstrate actual support for their position on any given issue.] Indeed, if advocacy
group decisions are primarily made by D.C. professionals, these
advocates themselves may be unsure how broadly their claims resonate
until potentially attentive publics are actually engaged.

Theorists debate whether signing a petition of support without
having a role in crafting the appeal is a meaningful voice and whether
petitions effectively channel public interests, but, at a minimum,
engaging a large number of supporters may help broader interests to
distinguish themselves from truly narrower ones. It suggests that the
organization is not "memberless" [@Skocpol2003] in the sense that they
can demonstrate some verifiable public support. An organization mobilizing its members or supporters to take some action lends weight to representational claims that might otherwise be indistinguishable from cheap talk claims that groups often make to represent broad constituencies.

The credibility of the signal that mass engagement provides may be complicated by "astroturf" campaigns, where organizations aim to evoke the image of a larger base of support than they really have. To the extent that support can be effectively faked or inflated using "astroturf" tactics, the political information that pressure campaigns provide will be less accurate and thus valuable to decisionmakers. 





### Types of Pressure Campaign Motivations

The effects of public pressure campaigns depend, in part, on the aims of a
campaign. I distinguish campaigns by which of four distinct aims
they pursue: (1) to win concessions by *going public*, (2) to *disrupt a perceived consensus*, or (3) to satisfy some audience other than policymakers by *going down fighting* or (4) to satisfy some audience other than policymakers by *credit claiming*. Going public and disrupting a perceived consensus are, respectively, forms of proactive and reactive outside lobbying. Going down fighting and credit claiming to describe
situations where the organization does not expect to influence policy but
mobilizes for other reasons.

**Going public.** Coalitions "go public" when they believe that
expanding the scope of conflict gives them an advantage. "Going public," "outside lobbying," or an "outside strategy"  contrasts with insider lobbying. It is used by Presidents
    [@Kernell2007], Members of Congress [@Malecha2012], interest groups
    [@Walker1991; @Dur2013], Lawyers, and Judges (Davis 2011). For
    example, organizations may use phone banks, targeting strategies,
    and direct-mail techniques to drum up and channel public support
    (Cooper 1985). As these
are the coalitions that believe they have more intense public
support, mass engagement is likely to skew heavily toward this side.

Going public is likely to be used by those disadvantaged (those
    @Schattschneider1975 calls the 'losers') in a policy process with
    less public attention.
Indeed, looking at a sample of rules from the Environmental Protection Agency, @Potter2017 finds that advocacy group-driven campaigns mobilize
far more people on average than industry-driven campaigns. Additionally,
many people may be inspired indirectly (e.g., through news stories) or
to engage with more effort (e.g., writing longer public comments) than people
mobilized by the side with less public support. This is important
because political information may be especially influential if
decisionmakers perceive a consensus. For example, the level of consensus among interest groups
    [@Golden1998; @Yackee2006JPART], especially business unity
    [@Yackee2006JOP; @Haeder2015], predicts policy change.^[It is not clear if the power of coalition unity is a result of strategic calculation by policymakers, a perceived obligation due to the normative power of consensus (e.g., following a majoritarian logic [@Dahl1989; @Mendelson2011]), or simply that unified demands are easier to process than opposing demands.



**Disrupting a perceived consensus.** I theorize that when coalitions
with less public support mobilize, it is a reaction to their opponents.
Because the impression of consensus is powerful, when a coalition goes
public, an opposing coalition may countermobilize. Because I theorize
that these are coalitions with less intense public support and its aim
is prevent a perceived consensus, I expect such campaigns to engage
fewer people, less effort per person, and yield a smaller portion of
indirect engagement.



**Going down fighting.** Finally, campaigns may target supporters rather
than policymakers. Sometimes organizations "go down fighting" to fulfill
supporters' expectations. For example, @Carpenter2020 finds that anti-slavery petitions were this type of campaign, where "the most important readers of a
petition are its signatories."  In the context of notice and comment rulemaking, after a draft policy is published, failing to secure one's demands is always a loss, so I use "going down fighting" as shorthand for
campaigns aimed primarily at fulfilling member, donor, or supporter
expectations and related logics that are internal to the organization,
including member retention or recruitment (@Carpenter2014b, @Carpenter2020), fundraising, or satisfying a
board of directors. For example, as Figure \@ref(fig:sierra) shows, the Sierra Club uses campaigns to collect
contact information of supporters and potential members. In this case,
given the executive-branch transition between 2010 when the rule was
initiated and 2017 when it was delayed, the Sierra Club may have had
little hope of protecting methane pollution standards, but for members
of the public who wanted to voice their opinion, the Sierra Club created
an easy way to do so, as long as users consented to "receive periodic
communication from the Sierra Club."

While such campaigns may engage many people, they are unlikely to affect
policy or to inspire countermobilization. I expect such campaigns to
occur on rules that have high partisan salience (e.g., rules following
major legislation passed on a narrow vote), rules that propose large
shifts on policy issues dear to member-funded public interest groups, or
rulemaking started shortly after presidential transitions when
executive-branch agendas shift more quickly than public opinion.

When a lobbying coalition with more intense public support successfully
mobilizes for reasons other than influencing policy, opposing coalitions
with less public support are not more likely to countermobilize.

Going public and going down fighting may be difficult to distinguish in
the observed public response. Indeed, members of the public may poorly
understand the different chances of success in each case. However,
lobbying organization do likely know their chances of success and should
thus invest less in sophisticated insider lobbying under the going down
fighting strategy. By identify cases where coalitions engage in large
public campaigns without corresponding investment in sophisticated
lobbying, I can assess whether countermobilization and is indeed less
likely in these cases. Table
\@ref(tab:campaigns-patterns) specifies the general pattern of
engagement suggested by each of the three reasons behind mass-comment
campaigns.

As Table \@ref(tab:campaigns-patterns) suggests, the relevant statistic
distinguishing patterns is the *relative* number of each type of comment
on each side on a given rulemaking docket. Even among rules targeted by
campaigns, salience varies significantly, and thus "high" and "low" numbers of comments will differ across rules. Importantly, even
campaigns that achieve very low public response rates appear in these
data. Because campaigns aim to collect thousands of comments, it is
implausible that even the most unpopular position would achieve no
supportive responses. For example, @Potter2017 found Poultry Producers
averaging only 319 comments per campaign. While this is far from the
Sierra Club's average of 17,325 comments per campaign, it is also far
from zero.

#### Public and private aims

Public pressure campaigns claim to represent and evoke the public interest. For example, the Oceana coalition framed its mass mobilization effort to curb the
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's 2017 Proposed Offshore Oil and Gas
Leasing Program as a "petition signed by 67,275 self-proclaimed United
States residents," suggesting that organizations consider these efforts
as akin to petitions. In the same statement, Oceana also claimed the
support of "more than 110 East Coast municipalities, 100 Members of
Congress, 750 state and local elected officials, and 1,100 business
interests, all of whom oppose offshore drilling," suggesting that claims
of public and elected official support aim to provide similar kinds of
political information.

Appeals to the government are almost always couched in the language of
public interest, even when true motivations are private
[@Schattschneider1975]. 

> TODO: MORE ABOUT PUBLIC VS PRIVATE COALITIONS TO SET UP HYPOTHESES. ESP. ADD MORE ABOUT PRIVATE COALITIONS' RESOURCES 


While coalitions may form around various material and ideological
conflicts, those most likely to be advantaged by going public or going
down fighting are public interest groups---organizations primarily
serving an idea of the public good rather than the material interests of
their members.^[@Potter2017 similarly distinguishes "advocacy groups" from
    "industry groups." @Berry1999 calls these groups "citizen groups" and emphasizes conflict over cultural issues. While some public
    interest groups focus on conservative or progressive cultural
    issues, like religious education, immigration, or endangered
    species, many are more focused on the public provision or protection
    of public goods such as national parks, consumer product safety
    standards, air quality, drinking water, and public safety.
    One exception may be types of membership organizations that are both
    broad and often focused on material outcomes for their members, such
    as labor unions. @Potter2017 puts unions in the "Industry" category.
    I take a different approach based on the coalition with whom such
    groups lobby. If a union lobbies alongside businesses (see @Mildenberger2020), I classify
    this as a private interest-driven coalition. If a union lobbies with
    public interest groups on public health or safety issues, I classify
    this as a public interest.] Thus, I theorize that mass mobilization is most
likely to occur in conflicts of public versus private interests or
public versus public interests (i.e., between coalitions led by groups
with distinct cultural ideals or desired public goods), provided they
have sufficient resources to run a campaign. If true, one implication is
that mass mobilization will systematically run counter to concentrated
business interests where they conflict with the values of public
interest groups with sufficient resources to mobilize.



### Types of Public Engagement

I classify supporters into three types that help describe key pieces of
political information. I illustrate these types in the context of public
comments. Comments that are exact copies of a form letter are akin to
petition signatures from supporters who were engaged by a campaign to
comment with minimal effort. Commenters that also take time to add text
indicate more intense preferences.^[Mobilizing organizations often emphasize the number of people who took the time to write personalized comments. For example, Earthjustice noted the number of people who wrote personalized comments when it uploaded its mass comment campaign. "Attached is the file containing the names of 37,127 individuals who have submitted public comments urging the Environmental Protection Agency to ban organophosphate and carbamate pesticides. In addition to signing on in support of the following letter, 6,837 individuals of the total number have submitted personalized comments." ([EPA-HQ-OPP-2012-0161-0087](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OPP-2012-0161-0087))] Finally, commenters who express
solidarity in similar but distinct phrases indicate they were engaged
indirectly, perhaps by a news story or a social media post about the campaign, as campaign messages spread beyond those initially
targeted.^[It is possible that some people in this latter category engage purely on their own initiative, but any impact they have likely comes from their alignment with a coalition. Furthermore, as I show
    below, wholly original comments are rare.] Because the success of a mobilization effort is moderated
by public support, broader public interest group coalitions ought to
mobilize more people, more effort per person, and more people indirectly
for the same amount of mobilization effort (e.g., spending or
solicitations).

Public interest group coalitions mobilize more successfully than
business-driven coalitions. Indicators of success include (1) the number
of comments supporting a coalition, (2) the effort per comment, and (3) the
number of comments mobilized indirectly.

The size of each group thus offers political information to
policymakers, including coalition resources, the intensity of sentiment,
and the potential for conflict to spread. The first two types signal two
kinds of intensity or resolve. First, they show the mobilizers'
willingness to commit resources to the issue. Second, costly actions
show the intensity of opinions among the mobilized segment of the public
[@Dunleavy1991]. The number of people engaged by a campaign is not
strictly proportional to an organization's investment. The less people
care, the more it costs to mobilize them. The third type indicates
potential contagion. Indications that messages spread beyond those
initially targeted may be especially powerful [@Kollman1998].

Information about organizational resolve, the intensity of public demands, and contagiousness are thus produced, but such political
information will only influence decisions if these signals are processed
in a way that captures this information and relays it to decisionmakers.
These organizational processes may vary significantly across agencies.


### Hypotheses About the Drivers of Mass Mobilization

```{theorem,  support} 

```

(ref:support) Outsider Hypothesis

> **(ref:support):** Lobbying coalitions
mobilize mass engagement when they perceive the attentive public is on
their side, have sufficient resources and perceive an opportunity to
influence policy.

The key part of this hypothesis is that mobilizing is correlated with
existing public support, what might be called "grass-roots" support. 


The
converse---that organizations mobilize when they have less public
support---could also be true. For example, business groups that are
already advantaged in low salience rulemaking may decide to leverage
their superior resources further to mobilize support to alter a bad
reputation or bolster claims that they represent more than their private
interest. If mobilization most often takes this "astroturf" form, this
would be evidence against 
(ref:support) and Schattschneider's argument that it is the
disadvantaged who seek to expand the scope of the conflict.

```{theorem,  insider} 
Public pressure campaigns are most often mobilized by the side with more resources.
```

(ref:insider) Insider Hypothesis

Public pressure campaigns are most often mobilized by the side with more resources.


The latter parts of (ref:support) regarding sufficient resources and political
opportunity are scope conditions. Most organizations that are
disadvantaged in low-salience rulemaking also lack resources to launch
mass mobilization campaigns. If an organization does not perceive a
lobbying opportunity, it would be incorrect to call mobilization a
lobbying strategy. Many factors may contribute to perceived political
opportunities. For example, @Moore2017 finds that agencies that use high
levels of expertise (as defined by @Selin2015) receive fewer comments,
possibly because mobilizing organizations perceive these rules to be
less open to influence.

```{hypothesis, disrupt}
\@ref(hyp:disrupt)
```

(ref:disrupt) Hypothesis 1b

> **(ref:disrupt):** When a lobbying coalition with more intense public support mobilizes successfully in response to an opportunity to influence policy, opposing coalitions with less public support are more likely to countermobilize, but with proportionally smaller results.

The first part of (ref:disrupt) would be undermined if lobbying organizations
with less public support are no more likely to engage in outside
lobbying when their opponents do so. While @Potter2017 found industry
groups were no more likely to advocate for rules to be strengthened,
weakened or withdrawn, this does not mean that they are no more likely
to mobilize when their opponents do so.

The second part of this hypothesis---that countermobilization is
proportionally smaller---rests on the intuition that the scale and the intensity of public engagement are moderated by preexisting support for
the proposition that people are being asked to support. It is possible
that the "potentially mobilized" segments of the public are unrelated to
public support before being contacted by the campaign, for example, if
mobilization is driven more by partisan identities than issue
preferences.

```{proposition, publicinterest}

```

(ref:public interest) Hypothesis 1c

> **(ref:public interest):** Public interest group coalitions mobilize more often than
business-driven coalitions.

(ref:public interest) posits a conditional logic in the
decision to mobilize. If resources purely determined outside lobbying,
business-driven coalitions would often dominate, as they do elsewhere.
However, I argue, because outside lobbying can alter the decision
environment, those who have the advantage in the usual rulemaking
process (where a more limited set of actors participate) have little
incentive to expand the scope of the conflict.
