## Introduction {#why-intro}

<!--Much of our knowledge about civic participation beyond voting comes from surveys and qualitative studies of particular groups. -->

Participatory processes like public comment periods, where government
agencies must solicit public input on draft policies, are said to provide political oversight opportunities [@Balla1998; @Mccubbins1984], democratic legitimacy [@Croley2003; @Rosenbloom2003], and new technical information [@Yackee2006JPART; @Nelson2012]. While recent scholarship on agency policymaking has shed light on sophisticated lobbying by businesses, we know surprisingly little about the vast majority of public comments, which are submitted by ordinary people as part of public pressure campaigns.

Activists frequently target agency policymaking with letter-writing campaigns, petitions, protests,
and mobilizing people to attend hearings, all classic examples of "civic engagement" [@Verba1987]. As I show below, most comments submitted to regulations.gov are part of organized campaigns, more akin to petition signatures than "deliberative" participation or sophisticated lobbying. Indeed, approximately 40 million out of 50 million (80%) of these public comments mobilized by just 100 advocacy organizations.


Yet civic engagement and organized public pressure remains poorly understood in the context of bureaucratic policymaking.
While practitioners and administrative law scholars have long pondered
what to make of mass commenting, political scientists have had
surprisingly little to say about this kind of civic participation and the role of public pressure in agency rulemaking. 

The contentious politics that inspire the majority of public comments have no place in leading models of bureaucratic policymaking and have largely been ignored by political scientists.
Foundational scholarship on rulemaking [@Furlong2005, @Furlong1997, @Furlong1998, @Kerwin2011] focuses on interest group lobbying. Theoretical models focus on how agencies learn about policy problems, negotiate or avoid accountability to various principals, or balance interest-group demands.^[On learning, see @Kerwin2011 and empirical studies by @Yackee2012,
    @Cook2017, @Gordon2018, and @Walters2019. See @Gailmard2017 and
    @Libgober2018 for information-based models where comments reveal information to the agency.
    On accountability to elected officials, see @Furlong1997, @Nou2016,
    @Potter2016, @Woods2018, and @Yackee2009RegGov. 
    @Potter2014dis develops a signaling model where agencies propose and principals veto rules depending, in part, on their beliefs about interest group preferences.
    On interest-group balancing, see @Yackee2006JOP, @Yackee2006JPART,
    and @Kerwin2011. A key assumption of Libgober's (2018) model is that
    bureaucrats have a distribution of preferences over interest group
    positions, about which they are uncertain unless groups reveal their
    preferences through commenting.]

<!--Most scholars are skeptical that public pressure can affect rulemaking.-->

To the extent that scholars address the input of ordinary people at all, both
existing theory and empirical scholarship suggest skepticism that it
matters. (By "ordinary" people, I simply mean people who are not
professional policy-influencers.)
Empirical scholarship finds that economic elites and business groups
dominate American politics in general [@Jacobs2005,@Soss2007, Hertel-Fernandez2019, @Hacker2003, @Gilens2014] and rulemaking in
particular. While some are optimistic that requirements for agencies to
solicit and respond to public comments on proposed rules allow "civil
society" to provide public oversight [@Michaels2015; @Metzger2010], most
studies find that participants in rulemaking often represent elites and
business interests [@Seifter2016UCLA; @Crow2015; @Wagner2011; @West2009; @Yackee2006JOP; @Yackee2006JPART; @Golden1998; @Haeder2015; @Cook2017, LibgoberCarpenter2018].
<!--
From a strategic perspective, agency officials are not directly
accountable to voters. And even if organized groups do supplement
congressional and judicial checks on executive power, the groups that
participate in rulemaking represent only certain (if any) segments of
the public and may not represent them well [@Seifter2016UCLA].-->

Becasue scholars are skeptical about rulemaking as a venue for collective action, most dismiss public pressure campaigns as epiphenomenal to bargaining with political principals
or interest groups. Indeed, almost all empirical studies of rulemaking
discard unsophisticated comments from ordinary people, as evident from a
comprehensive review of scholarship on "The Politics of Rulemaking" by
@Yackee2019, who finds skepticism about citizen comments, but no studies
analyzing public pressure campaigns as a lobbying tactic:

> "@Kerwin2011 point out that a citizen must know not only that a regulation is being formulated but also how and when to participate. This is a high bar for most Americans. Second, to be influential during rulemaking, commenters may require resources and technical expertise. As @Epstein2014 suggest, agency rule-writers---who are often chosen because of their technical or policy-specific expertise---privilege the type of data-driven arguments and reasoning
that are not common to citizen comments." (p. 10)

For any particular lay commenter, this conclusion seems inescapable; individuals acting alone are unlikely to affect policy. As Hacker and Pierson (Forthcoming) observe, 

>"[The United States'] institutional terrain advantages political actors with the capacity to work across multiple venues, over extended periods, and in a political environment where coordinated government action is difficult, and strategies of evasion and exit from regulatory constraints are often successful. These capacities are characteristic of organized groups, not individual voters."

But groups occasionally mobilize a large number of people, usually behind a more sophisticated lobbying effort. Without a systematic understanding of the scale and impact of public participation--*group-mediated* participation--in rulemaking, it is impossible to answer normative questions about how participatory processes like public comment periods may enhance or undermine various democratic ideals.
<!--These bursts of civic participation may affect
rulemaking [@Coglianese2001], but **this intuition has yet to be tested.**-->

Scholars' neglect of public pressure campaigns is surprising given that most people are only
aware of agency rulemaking when it is the target of a high-profile mass
mobilization campaign.^[Some of the most contentious recent public controversies involve
    bureaucratic policymaking. For example, along with 50 thousand
    protesters in Washington D.C., the State Department Received 1.2
    million comments on the Environmental Impact Statement for the
    Keystone Pipeline. Similarly, along with the thousands of protesters
    supporting the Standing Rock Sioux protest to the Dakota Access
    Pipeline, the Army Corps of Engineers received hundreds of thousands
    of comments. Alongside protest actions that included shutting down
    many websites, the Federal Communications Commission's open internet
    rule received 22 million comments. While some of these comments
    appear to be fake, the scale of public engagement is remarkable
    given how little attention political scientists have paid to it.
    Fake public comments also raise the question of why an organization
    would bother to generate fake public input if it did not matter, as
    its omission from theories of bureaucratic policymaking would seem
    to imply.] While most rules receive little attention,
the ease of online mobilizing and commenting has, like other forms of
participation [@Boulianne2018], created exponential increases in the
number of rules in which thousands and even millions of people engage
(see Figure \@ref(fig:comments-per-year); note that comments per rule are on a
logarithmic scale).^[Proposed rules that have attracted the most public attention have
    been published by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC,
    omitted from this plot), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
    the Department of Interior (DOI), the Bureau of Ocean Energy
    Management (BOEM), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB),
    and Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).] Occasionally, a large number of people are
paying attention. <!--These bursts of civic participation may affect
rulemaking [@Coglianese2001], but this intuition has yet to be tested.-->



The general failure to explain or account for public pressure campaigns in models of bureaucratic policymaking is also striking in light of how agencies advertise public
comment periods as an opportunity for a voice in government
decisions.^[I focus on public comments in rulemaking, but the theories and
    methods here may also apply to other kinds of political engagement
    such as through social media or protests as well as to other
    political decisions, including state-level rulemaking. Social media
    engagement may be especially important if agencies implement the
    recommendations of @ACUS2018 that "Agencies should consider using
    social media before or in connection with direct final rulemaking to
    quickly identify whether there are significant or meaningful
    objections" (p. 34).] Big red letters across the top of the Regulations.gov
homepage solicit visitors to "Make a difference. Submit your comments
and let your voice be heard" and "Participate today!" (Figure \@ref(fig:regsgov). A blue "Comment Now!" button accompanies a short description of each draft
policy and pending agency action. 
Public comment periods on proposed agency
rules is described as "an important part of democracy" (WSJ 2017),
"often held out as the purest example of participatory democracy in
actual American governance" [@Herz2016]. @Rossi1997 finds that "courts, Congress, and scholars have elevated participation in rulemaking to
a sacrosanct status...greater participation is generally viewed as
contributing to democracy."

While "ordinary" members of the public may occasionally provide novel
and useful technical information to expert bureaucrats, such
sophisticated means of influencing policy are out of reach for the vast
majority of people. Thus, to investigate the potential role of ordinary
people in bureaucratic politics I look elsewhere---not because ordinary
people never provide novel and useful technical information, but because
this is not how most people attempt to influence policy, nor, I argue,
how we should expect ordinary people to have influence.

Most public comments are, in fact, of the type suggested by the
solicitations on Regulations.gov---ordinary people voicing opinions on a proposed policy. They do not provide useful technical information or
suggest specific edits to policy texts like the interest group comments
that have thus far captured the attention of political scientists. If
they add information to rulemaking, it is a different, more political
flavor of information. Indeed as Figure
\@ref(fig:comments-per-year) shows, every year since 2008, most people who
comment on draft regulations have done so as a result of a public pressure campaign.^[At least for agencies participating in regulations.gov. See
    sections
    \@ref(why-methods) and
    \@ref(why-results) for my definition and methods for identifying mass comments.] Public engagement in rulemaking is highly
clustered on a few rules made salient by these campaigns. It is
plausible that at least some of the time, such campaigns aim to
influence policy. It is also plausible that thousands of people engaging
may alter the politics of these policy processes, but this hypothesis
remains untested. Indeed, we have much to understand about the causes
and effects of these campaigns before we are in a position to ask if
they are a mechanism for groups to influence policy. Most critically, we
must understand who mobilizes and why.

The kind of politics created by mass engagement has a few notable
features. It is contentious; most ordinary people are not engaging in
deliberation; they are simply making demands. Importantly, however,
processes like public comment periods channel contentious demands into
institutionalized policy processes rather than undermining them. In
short, the politics of rulemaking created by public pressure campaigns is much
more contentious than most rulemakings, but also much more
institutionalized than most contentious politics. Mass engagement in
rulemaking thus presents a novel context to examine the consequences of
broader public participation in typically insider-dominated policymaking and how
public pressure may condition how political decisions are made.

Public pressure campaigns expand civic participation in policymaking.^[If we define "civic participation" as "acts aimed at influencing governmental decisions [@Verba1987 p. 2], signing a petition or form comment counts. However, some consider true
participation to be deliberative, which mass comment campaigns are not.
Other criteria posed by normative theorists that participation should be "genuine," "informed," or "reasoned" are more difficult to assess. Normative theorists may debate whether deliberation among a small number of people is preferable to a large number of people simply expressing their preferences, but empirically, public participation in bureaucratic policymaking is much more the latter [@Shapiro2008b].]
Surely, those who engage are far from representative of the broader public [@Verba1987], but in many ways, they must be more representative than the handful of political insiders who participate in most policy processes. 

If the usual participants have "an upper-class accent" [@Schattschneider1942], does adding thousands of more voices dilute this bias? I argue that the answer depends on how people are mobilized. If public pressure is mobilized by the usual participants to create an impression of public support, it may merely legitimize the demands of powerful interest groups.
