## Introduction {#why-intro}

<!--Much of our knowledge about civic participation beyond voting comes from surveys and qualitative studies of particular groups. -->

Participatory processes like public comment periods, where government
agencies must solicit public input on draft policies, are said to provide political oversight opportunities [@Balla1998; @Mccubbins1984], democratic legitimacy [@Croley2003; @Rosenbloom2003], and new technical information [@Yackee2006JPART; @Nelson2012]. While recent scholarship on agency policymaking has shed light on sophisticated lobbying by businesses, we know surprisingly little about the vast majority of public comments, which are submitted by ordinary people as part of public pressure campaigns.

I argue that the extent to which public comment periods serve these functions and provide many of the normative benifits that proponents assert them to have depends on who participates. To the extent that participation is driven by public pressure campaigns, the normative value of public comment periods depends on who organizes these campaigns. 

If public pressure campaigns follow the ususal patterns of interest group lobbying, which is dominated by the groups with the most resources, then the proceedrual legitimacy they provide is merely a veneer masking the influence of powerful political insiders. Instead of encouraging political oversight, they would discourage it. Instead of diversifyign the available information, they would merely reinforce the claims and issue frames of powerful insiders. We would expect pressure campaings to push policy further in the direction desired by powerful insiders.

If, on the other hand, public pressure campaigns are not like other lobbying tacktics in the sense that they are are not dominated by the usual suspects, they may yet improve the democratic credentials of American policymaking, expand political oversight, and diversify the information availble to policymakers. To the extent that the possiblity of public pressure tacktics empowers groupst that are ususally left out of the policy process, pressure campaings may blunt the influence of powerful insiders.

Thus, in order understand the empirical effects or normative value of paticipatory processes like public comment periods, we first need to know who participates and why. Specifically, to understant the impact of public attention, we need to know who is behind public pressure campaings.

I develop and assess two competing theories of who should mobilize public pressure campaigns and why. Each theory has observable implications for which types of groups will run campaigns in different contexts. One stems from leading theories of bureaucratic decisionmaking and interest group lobbying. It predicts that groups with more resources will dominate. The other stems from democratic theories. It predicts that groups with fewer material resources, but popular support dominate. To assess these theories, I assemble a new dataset of over 500 public pressure campaigns that collectivly mobilized approximately 50 million people across three administrations from 2005 to 2020. Using a mix of qualitative hand-coding and computational text analysis, I identify the coalitions of groups behind each campaign and the the type of interest they represent.
