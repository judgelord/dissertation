## Introduction {#why-intro}



Participatory processes like public comment periods on draft policies, are said to provide democratic legitimacy [@Croley2003; @Rosenbloom2003], political oversight opportunities [@Balla1998; @Mccubbins1984],  and new technical information [@Yackee2006JPART; @Nelson2012]. 

In civics classrooms and Norman Rockwell paintings, raising concerns to government is an individual affair. Scholars, too, often focus on studying and improving the ability of individuals to participate in policymaking [@Cuellar2005]. But in practice, the capacities required to lobby effectively on matters of national policy are those of organized groups, not individual voters.

<!--PUZZLE-->
Bureaucratic policymaking, in particular, is the ideal context for powerful organized interests to dominate. Policies made by specialized agencies are likely to have concentrated benefits or costs that lead interest groups, especially businesses, to dominate [@Lowi1969, @Lowi1972].  Organizations with superior resources use them to flood policymakers with technical information [@Wagner2010].

And yet, activists frequently target agency policymaking with letter-writing campaigns, petitions, protests,
and mobilizing people to attend hearings, all classic examples of "civic engagement" [@Verba1987]. While recent scholarship on agency policymaking has shed light on sophisticated lobbying, especially by businesses, we know surprisingly little about the vast majority of public comments, which are submitted by ordinary people as part of public pressure campaigns. As I show below, most comments submitted to regulations.gov are part of organized campaigns, more akin to petition signatures than "deliberative" participation or sophisticated lobbying.


While practitioners and administrative law scholars have long pondered
what to make of letter-writing campaigns targeting the bureaucracy, political scientists have had
surprisingly little to say about this kind of civic participation and the role of public pressure in bureaucratic policymaking. Much of our knowledge about civic participation beyond voting comes from surveys [e.g. @Verba1987] and qualitative studies of particular groups. 
Models of bureaucratic policymaking focus on the participation of sophisticated lobbying groups and neither explain nor account for public pressure campaigns.
Civic engagement and organized public pressure thus remain poorly understood in the context of bureaucratic policymaking. 

To fill this gap, I bring scholarship on policy advocacy groups^[Organizations that mobilize people to engage in policy debates (e.g., through letter-writing campaigns) go by many names, each with slightly different connotations. These include pressure groups, policy advocacy groups [@Potter2017], citizen groups [@Berry1999], policy change organizations [McNutt2005]. TODO: NAIL DOWN MY NOMENCLATURE.] into theories of bureaucratic policymaking. Doing so reveals competing intuitions about the drivers of public participation, which I then assess using a large new dataset of participation in federal agency rulemaking. 

I develop and assess two theories of who should mobilize public pressure campaigns and why.  One stems from leading theories of bureaucratic decision-making and interest group lobbying. It predicts that groups with more resources will dominate all forms of lobbying, including public pressure campaigns. The other emerges from democratic theories. It predicts that pressure campaigns will generally be used by groups with fewer material resources but more popular support. <!--Schattschneider1975 Kollman1998--> I argue that the extent to which public comment periods serve the functions and provide the normative benefits that proponents assert depends on who participates. To begin to make sense of public participation in bureaucratic policymaking, I develop a typology of different kinds of participation, with implications for the normative value of participatory institutions. Because political participation is often a collective affair, this includes a typology of public pressure campaigns.To the extent that public pressure campaigns drive participation, the normative value of participatory processes like public comment periods depends on who organizes these campaigns. 

Each theory has observable implications for which types of groups will run campaigns in different contexts. Suppose public pressure campaigns follow the usual patterns of interest group lobbying, where the groups with the most resources dominate. In that case, the procedural legitimacy they provide is merely a veneer masking the influence of powerful political insiders. Instead of encouraging political oversight, they would discourage it. Instead of diversifying the available information, they would merely reinforce the claims and issue frames of powerful insiders. We would expect a pressure campaign to push policy further in the direction desired by powerful insiders.
On the other hand, if the usual suspects do not dominate public pressure campaigns, they may yet improve the democratic credentials of American policymaking, expand political oversight, and diversify the information available to policymakers. To the extent that the possibility of public pressure tactics empowers groups that are usually left out of the policy process, pressure campaigns may blunt the influence of powerful insiders.
Thus, to understand the empirical effects or normative value of participatory processes like public comment periods, we first need to know who participates and why. Specifically, we need to know who is behind public pressure campaigns.


To assess these theories, I assemble a new dataset of thousdands of public pressure campaigns that collectively mobilized over 50 million public comments across three administrations from 2005 to 2020. Using a mix of qualitative hand-coding and computational text analysis, I identify the coalitions of groups behind each campaign and the type of interest they represent. 

I find that participation is better explained by theories of democratic institutions and conflict expansion rather than existing theories of bureaucratic policymaking. Participation is overwehlmingly driven by policy advocacy efforts of a few public interest groups. Indeed, approximately 40 million out of 50 million (80%) of these public comments were mobilized by just 100 advocacy organizations. Traditional membership organizations and individuals account for a smaller portion and "astroturf" campaigns are rare.
