## Introduction {#why-intro}

Participatory processes like public comment periods on draft policies are said to provide democratic legitimacy [@Croley2003; @Rosenbloom2003], political oversight opportunities [@Balla1998; @McCubbins1984], and valuable new information for policymakers [@Yackee2006JPART; @Nelson2012]. The extent to which participatory processes make more democratic, accountable, or informed policy depends on who participates and why. <!--see @Button2018-->

In civics classrooms and Norman Rockwell paintings, raising concerns to the government is an individual affair. Scholars, too, often focus on studying and improving the ability of individuals to participate in policymaking [@Cuellar2005; @Zavestoski2006; @Shane2009]. But in practice, the capacities required to lobby effectively on matters of national policy are those of organized groups, not individual citizens [@Hacker2021].

<!--PUZZLE-->
<!--Each sentence here should be a topic sentence of the theory section-->

Bureaucratic policymaking, in particular, is the ideal context for powerful organized interests to dominate. Policies made by specialized agencies are likely to have concentrated benefits or costs that lead interest groups, especially businesses, to dominate [@Lowi1969; @Lowi1972, @Wilson1989]. Agency policymakers are often experts who are embedded in the professional and epistemic networks of the industries they support and regulate [@Gormley1986; @Carpenter1998; @Epstein2014]. Organizations with superior resources often flood policymakers with technical information valued both in the specific legal context of bureaucratic policymaking and technocratic rationality more broadly [@Wagner2010]. Because agencies are generally framed as "implementers" rather than "makers" of policy, even the most value-laden policy documents are often framed as derivative of legislative statutes, even when these statutes are decades old. The assumption that Congress makes political decisions, not agencies, persists even as agencies write and rewrite policies that cite the same old statutes, advancing and reversing major policy programs under each subsequent president. All of these features---concentrated costs and benefits, the importance of expertise, and the anti-politics of the technocratic frame---privilege legal and technical experts and thus the organizations with the resources to deploy them.

<!--PUZZEL-->

And yet, activists frequently target agency policymaking with letter-writing campaigns, petitions, protests---all classic examples of "civic engagement" [@Verba1987]. While recent scholarship on bureaucratic policymaking has shed light on sophisticated lobbying, especially by businesses, we know surprisingly little about the vast majority of public comments, which come from the lay public. The few studies to address the massive level of participation from the lay public (i.e., not professional policy influencers) tend to *compare* it (often unfavorably) to the participation of more sophisticated actors [@Balla2020] or suggest ways to *improve* the "quality" of citizen input. Raising the quality of citizen comments means making them more like the technical comments of lawyers and professional policy influencers [@Cuellar2005; @Farina2011; @Farina2012; @Epstein2014; @Farina2018; @Mendelson2011]. 

I argue that contrasting the quality of input from citizens and lobbying organizations is misguided. Indeed, "it can be difficult to distinguish an individual's independent contribution from an interest-group-generated form letter" [@Seifter2016UCLA, pg. 1313]. Rather, to study public participation, we must *attribute* public engagement to the broader lobbying effort it supports. I show that most public comments in U.S. federal agency rulemaking are part of organized campaigns, more akin to petition signatures than "deliberative" participation or sophisticated lobbying. Moreover, nearly all comments are mobilized to support more sophisticated lobbying efforts. Comments from the lay public are neither "deliberative" nor "spam." People participate because they are *mobilized* into broader lobbying efforts. Because nearly all mobilizing organizations are repeatedly lobbying, these public pressure campaigns are often broader than the policy they target. Often they aim to raise attention and build power for future policy fights.

Without an accurate and systematic understanding of public participation---*group-mediated* participation---in bureaucratic policymaking, it is impossible to answer normative questions about how participatory processes like public comment periods may enhance or undermine various democratic ideals.
Surely, those who tend to engage are far from representative of the broader public [@Verba1987]. That said, even a fairly elite segment of the public is likely more representative than the handful of political insiders who usually participate in bureaucratic policymaking. If the usual participants have "an upper-class accent" [@Schattschneider1942], does adding thousands of more voices dilute this bias? The answer depends on how people are mobilized. If the "usual suspects" mobilize public participation to create a misleading impression of broad public support for their policy positions, it may merely legitimize the demands of the same group of powerful interest groups that would dominate without broader public participation. If, however, public pressure campaigns are used by groups that are typically excluded or disadvantaged in the policy process, then public comment processes may democratize bureaucratic policymaking.

<!--GAP-->

While practitioners and administrative law scholars have long pondered what to make of letter-writing campaigns targeting the bureaucracy, political scientists have had surprisingly little to say about this kind of civic participation and the role of public pressure in bureaucratic policymaking. Scholars trained in law tend to focus on the normative and legal import of public participation and pay less attention to how groups gain and wield power [notable exceptions include @Coglianese2001; @Wagner2010; @Wagner2011; @Seifter2016UCLA]. Nearly all empirical studies of bureaucratic policymaking in political science journals exclude form letters from their analysis. While @Coglianese2001 and @Shapiro2008 suggested that mass comments may have important effects, including on the time it takes to make policy, studies addressing more than a few example cases have only appeared recently. The most comprehensive study to date [@Moore2017] finds less participation when agencies rely more heavily on expertise. Examining policies made by the Environmental Protection Agency, @Potter2017 finds that advocacy groups mobilize more often than industry groups, and @Balla2020 find that form letters are cited less often and are less associated with policy change than comments written by lawyers and other professional policy influencers. 

While this growing body of scholarship has improved our understanding of bureaucratic policymaking,  public participation in bureaucratic policymaking is still largely under-tilled empirical terrain on which to extend and evaluate theories about civic participation and pressure politics. Much of our knowledge about civic participation beyond voting comes from surveys and qualitative studies of particular groups. In contrast, models of bureaucratic policymaking focus on the participation of sophisticated lobbying groups. These models neither explain nor account for public pressure campaigns. Thus, civic engagement in general and organized public pressure in particular remain poorly understood in the context of bureaucratic policymaking.

<!-- GAP IS SURPRISING -->

Political scientists' neglect of public pressure campaigns that target the bureaucracy is surprising given that some of the most contentious recent public controversies involve bureaucratic policymaking.[^footnote-recent-controversies]. Pressure campaigns are important because most people are only aware of bureaucratic policymaking when it is the target of a public pressure campaign. Indeed, because most agency policies receive so little attention, pressure campaigns often increase the level of public attention by several orders of magnitude. And as I show below, pressure campaigns have become more frequent. The ease of online mobilizing and commenting has, like other forms of participation [@Boulianne2018], greatly increased the number of policies on which thousands and even millions of people comment. 

[^footnote-recent-controversies]: While bureaucratic policymaking usually receives little attention, it is increasingly becoming a flashpoint for public controversies. For example, along with 50 thousand protesters in Washington D.C., the State Department Received 1.2 million comments on the Environmental Impact Statement for the Keystone Pipeline. Similarly, along with the thousands of protesters supporting the Standing Rock Sioux protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline, the Army Corps of Engineers received hundreds of thousands of public comments. Alongside protest actions that included shutting down many websites, the Federal Communications Commission's Open Internet Rule received millions of public comments. While some of these comments appear fake <!--[PEW CITE]-->[@Rinfret2021], the scale of public engagement is remarkable given how little attention political scientists have paid to it. Fake public comments also raise the question of why an organization would bother to generate fake public input if such comments did not matter, as the  omission from theories of bureaucratic policymaking would seem to imply.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "regulations-header.png"))
```


The general failure to explain and account for public pressure campaigns in models of bureaucratic policymaking is also striking in light of how agencies advertise public comment periods as an opportunity for a voice in government decisions. The regulations.gov homepage solicits visitors to "Make a difference. Submit your comments and let your voice be heard" and "Participate today!" (Figure \@ref(fig:regsgov)). A blue "Comment Now!" button accompanies a short description of each draft policy and pending agency action. Public comment periods on draft agency policies are described as "an important part of democracy" (WSJ 2017), "often held out as the purest example of participatory democracy in actual American governance" [@Herz2016]. @Rossi1997 finds that "courts, Congress, and scholars have elevated participation in rulemaking to a sacrosanct status...greater participation is generally viewed as contributing to democracy." (pg. 2) And yet, political scientists have paid little empirical or theoretical attention to the role of public pressure in bureaucratic policymaking.

<!--fill gap-->

To fill this gap, I bring theories of conflict expansion and pressure tactics into theories of bureaucratic policymaking. Because theories of bureaucratic policymaking focus on the power of information and expertise in policymaking, I highlight how public pressure campaigns create new information about the political context ("political information"). Doing so reveals competing intuitions about the drivers of public participation, which I assess using a large new dataset of participation in federal agency rulemaking.

<!-- THEORY part 1
<!-- summary, usual suspects vs underdog. this could be shorter, longer below-->

To begin to make sense of public participation in bureaucratic policymaking, I develop a typology of different kinds of participation, with implications for the normative value of participatory institutions. Because political participation is almost always a collective affair, this includes a typology of public pressure campaigns.

First, I develop and assess two theories of who should mobilize public pressure campaigns and why. Each theory has observable implications for which types of groups will run campaigns in different contexts. One stems from scholarship on bureaucratic decision-making and interest group lobbying. It predicts that groups with more resources will dominate all forms of lobbying, including public pressure campaigns. The other emerges from theories of democratic politics. It predicts that groups with fewer material resources but more popular support will more often use public pressure campaigns. 
<!--The extent to which public comment periods serve the functions and provide the normative benefits that proponents assert depends on who participates. -->
To the extent that public pressure campaigns drive participation, the normative value of participatory processes like public comment periods depends on who organizes these campaigns. 

Suppose public pressure campaigns follow the usual patterns of interest group lobbying, where the groups with the most resources dominate. In that case, the procedural legitimacy they provide is merely a veneer masking the influence of powerful political insiders. Instead of diversifying the available information, they would merely reinforce powerful insiders' claims and issue frames. We would expect pressure campaigns to push policy further in the direction desired by the most powerful insiders. 

On the other hand, if the usual suspects do not dominate public pressure campaigns, participatory processes may yet improve the democratic credentials of American policymaking, expand political oversight, and diversify the information available to policymakers. To the extent that public pressure tactics empower groups who are usually left out of the policy process, pressure campaigns may blunt the influence of powerful insiders. Thus, to understand the empirical effects or normative value of participatory processes like public comment periods, we first need to know who participates and why. To the extent that public participation is mobilized by campaigns, we need to know who is behind them.

<!--Theory: Part 2-->

Second, I offer a theory about the conditions under which we should see private and public interest group campaigns. I argue that public interest groups more often have incentives to launch public pressure campaigns than private interests. Private interests have incentives to sponsor campaigns (including astroturf campaigns) under much more limited conditions. Campaigns from private interests should thus be less common than campaigns from public interest groups. However, I argue, the resources required to run a campaign will lead a few large public interest groups to dominate.


<!--DATA -->

To assess these theories, I assemble a new dataset of thousands of public pressure campaigns that collectively mobilized millions of public comments across three administrations from 2005 to 2020. Using a mix of qualitative hand-coding and computational text analysis, I identify the coalitions of groups behind each campaign and the type of interest group they represent.

<!--FINDINGS-->

I find that mass participation in bureaucratic policymaking is better explained by theories of democratic institutions and conflict expansion rather than existing theories of bureaucratic policymaking. In other words, participation is overwhelmingly organized by relatively broad public interest groups who aim to shift rather than reinforce the typical balance of power in the policy process. 

While greater public participation means that broader interests are represented, the resources and capacity required to mobilize people constrains which type of organization can use these tactics.  Participation is overwhelmingly driven by the policy advocacy efforts of a few public interest groups. Indeed, just 100 advocacy organizations mobilized over 80% of all public comments. Traditional membership organizations and unaffiliated individuals account for a smaller portion, and "astroturf" campaigns are rare, almost exclusively arising in opposition to a large public interest group campaign, as my theory anticipates. 
One consequence of the concentration of organizing capacity is that public engagement in rulemaking is highly
clustered on a few rules made salient by public pressure campaigns. Moreover, because these large national advocacy groups are overwhelmingly more aligned with the Democratic party, the politics of public participation in bureaucratic policymaking look very different under Democratic and Republican presidents. Public pressure is much more likely to support policies made by Democrats than Republicans.

I proceed in the following steps. Section \@ref(why-theory) reviews the literature on civic engagement, democratic politics, and bureaucratic politics and then develops hypotheses about the causes of public engagement in bureaucratic policymaking. Section \@ref(why-data) introduces a novel dataset that systematically captures public participation in federal agency rulemaking. Section \@ref(why-methods) outlines methods to assess my hypotheses using text analysis to leverage public comments as both content-rich texts and large-n observational data. Section \@ref(why-results) presents the results of this analysis.
