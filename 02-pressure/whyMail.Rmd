\centerline{\textbf{\underline{NOTE TO READER}}}

\thispagestyle{empty}

The following chapter is part of a dissertation exploring the effects of public pressure campaigns on agency rulemaking, a technocratic policy process where “public participation” is usually limited to sophisticated lobbying but occasionally includes millions of people mobilized by public pressure campaigns. Public comment periods on proposed policies purport to provide democratic accountability. Yet theories of bureaucratic policymaking largely ignore the occasional bursts of civic engagement that generate the vast majority of public comments on proposed rules. To fill this gap, I build and test theories about the role of public pressure in policymaking. I collect and analyze millions of public comments to develop the first systematic measures of civic engagement and influence in bureaucratic policymaking. The outline of the dissertation is as follows:

# Theory

<!--% MAIN QUESTION --> 

**Incorporating mass engagement into theories of bureaucratic policymaking.**
How, if at all, should scholars incorporate mass engagement into models of bureaucratic policymaking? 
 I argue that mass engagement produces potentially valuable political information about the coalition that mobilized it.
Thus, depending on how agencies process political information, "going public" may occasionally be an effective strategy for organizations to influence policy, both directly and indirectly. However, influencing policy may not be the only reason to mobilize. 

<!--  % % PREVIEW 

The next section builds a causal theory. I theorize that activists' opportunities and strategies and latent public opinion drive engagement.

% The following section outlines methodologies to assess my three overarching questions and their component parts. These methods rely on analysis of comment and policy texts as large-n observational data. -->
