## Results: Patterns of Public Engagement in Rulemaking {#why-results}

### Most Comments Result from Public Pressure Campaigns

Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:meditated) posited that most people engage in the policy process due to organized public pressure campaigns. This is overwhelmingly true.  Figure
\@ref(fig:comments-mass) shows that every year since 2007, the vast majority of
comments on draft regulations posted to regulations.gov were the result of a public pressure campaign.

### Most Comments and Campaigns are Mobilized by Public Interest Coalitions

Public pressure campaigns are almost exclusively organized by coalitions that include groups that engage in sophisticated technical lobbying. This supports Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:coalitions). 
Indeed, just 100 organizations mobilized over 80% of comments on proposed rules posted to regulations.gov. <!--These top 100 mobilizing organizations each mobilized between `r 55` thousand and `r 4.2` million comments. -->

load(here("data", "org_comments_summary.Rdata"))

org_comments_summary %>% 
  kable3(caption = "Organizations Mobilizing the Most Public Comments 2005-2020")
```


Table \@ref(tab:toporgs) shows the top organizers of comments posted to regulations.gov.
In line with Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:public), nearly all of these top mobilizing organizations lobby together in public interest coalitions, especially on environmental issues. These coalitions include organizations that engage in sophisticated lobbying. Indeed, many of the most prolific organizers of public pressure campaigns also engage in sophisticated lobbying themselves. Public pressure is a complement, not an alternative to sophisticated technical lobbying.  

The percent of rules on which each organization lobbies with a pressure campaign rather than without one (the "Percent" column in Table \@ref(tab:toporgs)) shows only a few organizations using pressure campaigns the majority of the time they lobby. Most lobbying organizations use pressure campaigns a small percentage of the time they lobby in rulemaking. The most extreme example is the American Petroleum Institute (API), which lobbied on hundreds of rules between 2005 and 2020, more than most of the other top mobilizing organizations. Yet it almost never uses public pressure campaigns (at least in its own name). While API does frequently sponsor astroturf campaigns, it does so relatively rarely. Almost all of these top mobilizing organizations usually rely on their legal and policy teams alone. The fact that so many of the top mobilizers are also highly sophisticated lobbying organizations like the Sierra Club and API lends support to my argument that public pressure campaigns are one tool that advocacy organizations may use in addition to more insider tactics.

  mutate(both = str_detect(types, ";")) 
  
  
both <- filter(types, both) %>%
  group_by(coalition_type) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(comments))
```


In line with Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:public), `r percent_public` percent of public pressure campaigns are led by public interest coalitions, with only `r percent_private` led by private interest coalitions. 

In line with Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:public-success), public interest mass comment campaigns, on average, garner a larger response. The average number of comments for a public interest campaign is `r x$mean[2] %>% round()`. In contrast, the average number of comments for a private interest campaign is `r x$mean[1] %>% round()`. On rules where both public and private interest coalitions ran campaigns, the average response to the public interest campaign was `r both$mean[2] %>% round()`. The private interest campaigns were only `r both$mean[1] %>% round()`.



In line with Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:resources), large national policy advocacy organizations are responsible for most pressure campaigns targeting national policy. These organizations have the incentive as well as the resources and organizational capacity to launch campaigns.

<!--concluding paragraph where you summarize how your results matched up with your hypotheses. -->


### Private Interests Rarely Use Public Pressure

Only a few of the top mobilizing organizations lobby in coalitions that focus on narrow material interests. The most prolific is a coalition of oil and gas companies led by the American Petroleum Institute (API). This coalition includes national policy advocacy organizations funded by the oil and gas industry, including Consumer Energy Alliance, Energy Citizens, and Energy Nation. It also includes industry associations in adjacent sectors, such as the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America and Association of Oil Pipe Lines, and state-level industry associations, such as The Alaska Oil and Gas Association (AOGA). API lobbied on over 400 rulemaking dockets, but it only launched public pressure comment campaigns on a few rules. In line with Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:disrupt), environmental groups ran much larger campaigns on these same dockets. API only attached their name to one of these campaigns.

The only other private-interest coalition leader among the top 100 mobilizing organizations is Axcess Financial. Axcess led only one campaign in opposition to the CFPB's Payday Loans rule. <!--This case may be the only example where an industry-sponsored campaign was larger than the public interests campaign it opposed. 
TODO INVESTIGATE! 
TODO INVESTIGATE WOTUS RULE CAMPAIGNS -->

In line with Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:disrupt), private interest coalitions are less likely than public interest coalitions to lobby unopposed, suggesting that they often launch pressure campaigns in response to an opposing campaign. Of `r nrow(types)` coalition-scale pressure campaigns in the hand-coded sample, only `r types %>% filter(coalition_type == "Private", !both)%>% nrow()` private interest coalition ran a pressure campaign when they were not up against a public interest group's campaign. Yet `r types %>% filter(coalition_type == "Public", !both)%>% nrow()` public interest coalitions ran a pressure campaign when they were not up against a private interest group's campaign.

Table \@ref(tab:toporgs) shows the most commented-on dockets. The most prolific mobilizers are
national environmental organizations. A coalition of environmental organizations and their allies mobilized a majority of public comments five out of the top ten dockets (Figure \@ref(fig:topdockets). In part, this is because the
Environmental Protection Agency produces a large share of the
substantive rules posted to regulations.gov. However, it is notable
that nearly all of the top mobilizers generally
lobby together. 

The top private-interest mobilizer on these ten dockets was America's Energy Cooperatives (AEC). AEC mobilized significantly on the Clean Power
Plan but not on the subsequent Clean Power Plan repeal. If public
interest group mobilization on the Clean Power Plan was an example of
"going public" to pressure the Obama administration and then "going
down fighting" in the face of the Trump administration's repeal,
industry counter-mobilization responding to the first, but not the
second aligns with Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:disrupt). If AEC found their policy goals in the Clean Power Plan rulemaking threatened by the political information being generated by environmental groups, it would make sense to devote resources to their own public pressure campaign to disrupt any perceived consensus. If AEC were not concerned that environmental group mobilizing would affect the Clean Power Plan repeal, sponsoring a public pressure campaign would be a poor investment. Thus, while public interest groups had incentives to mobilize public comments in both cases, the private interests only had incentives to mobilize in the first. This mirrors the broader trend. 





Is civic engagement resulting from public pressure campaigns better understood as "astroturf" or "grassroots" participation?
In short, I find more grassroots participation than astroturf.



### Most Comments Occur on a Small Number of Salient Rules

One consequence of the dominance of a few national policy advocacy organizations is that public pressure campaigns target a narrow subset of the wide range of issues addressed by agency rulemaking. 
Public engagement in rulemaking is highly
clustered on a few rules made salient by these campaigns. 
Just ten rulemaking dockets account for `r percent(sum(topdockets$comments)/sum(rules$number_of_comments_received), accuracy = .01)` of comments (`r sum(topdockets$comments)`). Figure
\@ref(fig:topdockets) shows these ten dockets and the share of comments from each of the top twenty mobilizing organizations (see the legend on the right). The first pane is mass comments (99 or more form letters or copied text). The vast majority of the total comments come from this category (notice the x-axis is scaled to each pane). Partially unique and small batches of form letters (less than 99) are a tiny fraction of the total and concentrated on a few rules where different audiences were engaged.  Because public pressure requires resources and capacity, policy issues of interest to organizations with the resources and capacity to launch a campaign receive disproportionate amounts of public attention.

### Partisan Asymmetry 

Of the top 100 mobilizing organizations, 97 lobby in public interest coalitions. Only one of these organizations, the National Association for Gun Rights, is aligned with the political right.

<!--MOVE TO DISCUSSION OR APPENDIX?-->

Figure
\@ref(fig:comments-support) shows that many more comments mention support, until 2018 when there is
a fairly dramatic reversal in the share of comments mentioning "support" compared to those mentioning "oppose."  Whether the comment text includes "support" or "oppose" is a noisy signal. These words are not used in all comments
and do not always indicate support for or opposition to a rule. Still, given the partisan asymmetry in the mobilizing groups, it is plausible that this pattern is a result of the
changing regulatory agenda due to the change in the presidential
administration.

## Conclusion {#why-conclusion}

<!--hyp:mediated-->
Public participation in bureaucratic policymaking is overwhelmingly dominated by the lay public voicing opinions. They do not provide useful technical information or
suggest specific edits to policy texts like the interest group comments that have thus far captured the attention of political scientists. If
they add information to rulemaking, it is a different, more political
type of information. Because nearly all public participation in agency rulemaking is mobilized as part of a public pressure campaign, levels of public participation reveal information about levels of public support behind different lobbying coalitions. 

<!--hyp:coalitions-->
The political information generated by public pressure campaigns is not a substitute for sophisticated technical information; public pressure campaigns almost always explicitly support a more sophisticated lobbying effort. Coalitions that sponsor pressure campaigns almost always include sophisticated policy lobbying efforts. Moreover, almost all of the organizations that mobilize the most public comments also pursue inside lobbying strategies. Indeed, most of these organizations use pressure campaigns fairly rarely. 

<!--hyp:public hyp:public-success-->
A few public interest organizations mobilize the vast majority of civic engagement in bureaucratic policymaking. Few campaigns push for narrow private interests. Even fewer are astroturf campaigns, which are often anonymous, making it more difficult for them to support lobbying efforts. Compared to the usual suspects found in lobbying, especially in rulemaking, both the participants and organizations that mobilized them represent broader segments of the public. However, astroturf campaigns are most likely to occur precisely when public pressure is most decisive, so they may still present a normative concern.

<!--hyp:disrupt-->
When private interest coalitions use public pressure tactics, it is almost always in response to a much larger effort by public interest groups. They are never unopposed. I argue that this is because narrow private interests do not generally have incentives to expand the scope of conflict; their campaigns merely aim to disrupt any potential perceptions of a public consensus. In contrast, public interest group campaigns often go unopposed. I argue that this is because public interest groups often have incentives to mobilize supporters, even when their opponents do not.

<!--hyp:resources-->
Because public pressure campaigns require resources and specialized capacities, they shine a light on a fairly narrow set of policy issues that interest the few large national policy advocacy groups with the capacity to mobilize large numbers of people. 

Public pressure campaigns targeting the bureaucracy are primarily a tool used by left-aligned lobbying coalitions. The constituencies utilizing public pressure do not alternate under different presidents, as some theories would predict. Instead, organizations with the capacity to mobilize public pressure do so under both Democrat and Republican administrations, generally supporting the policies of the former and opposing the policies of the latter. 

In the end, public participation in bureaucratic policymaking is better explained by theories of democratic politics that focus on the dynamics of public conflicts than theories of bureaucratic policymaking that focus on technical information and expertise. Hope remains that public commenters may advance normative values that depend on diversifying voices in the policy process, resisting concentrated interests, and providing new information to policymakers. 

More research is required. Specifically, we need to know the extent to which campaigns aim to influence policy or build organizational capacity (e.g., by recruiting members) for future policy fights. The extent to which campaigns aim to affect policy determines the likely effects of any particular campaign and campaigns in general. In short, it matters whether campaigns affect policy. 

The distinction between public interest groups and businesses or private interest groups is a coarse distinction. While we can confidently say that pressure campaigns shift participation decisions away from business interests, more research is needed on the groups that dominate high-salience rules. How does this particular subset of public interest groups represent the public?

One way to study the relationship between public interest group lobbying and the broader public would be to identify nationally representative surveys that best align with particular policy debates. For example @Yackee2019 discusses a Pew Poll that found that Republicans and Democrats become more sympathetic to regulations when asked about more specific policies. Such evidence may allow us to test whether these particular public interest groups actually represent broader constituencies than the private interest groups they lobby against. 

If resources shape who is able to mobilize and thus which subset of policies receive public attention, more research on resources requirements for organizing public pressure may help explain why some policies get more public attention than others.  What exactly are the organizational capacities that allow organizations to pursue mass mobilizing? Answering this question may involve interviews with mobilizing groups and other seemingly similar groups that do not use this tactic.

Finally, because public participation is mediated through organizations, the normative value of public participation depends on how well these organizations represent the constituents they claim to represent. Future research should explore how well the claims that groups make match the support they are able to demonstrate through public pressure campaigns. For example, while mass comments show that people can be mobilized to support the cause, people may be misinformed about the policy (e.g.,the payday loan customer who thinks fees are too high but is persuaded to comment in opposition to a regulation on fees. It may also be that commenters are not who they say they are. For example, national audiences may be mobilized to sign a form letter which implies that they  represent a specifically affected area.
