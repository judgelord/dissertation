## Public comment periods:
### Usually an insiders' game, but occassionally not.

## Does it matter? 
![](tweet-lind.png) 
### But first: who, when, why?
1. Selection effects? 
2. How do we measures it? 

---

### Who mobilizes?
- Public interest groups / "advocacy" groups (Shapiro 2008; Potter 2017) / "societal constituencies" (Balla n.d.)
<!-- Tricky concepts! -->

### Who is mobilized? 
- Earnist, not so nieve (Yackee 2015)
- "Like-minded" 
<!-- Discusts some law professors, but collective action among like minded is the bread and butter of polticis  -->

### Who's interests do they represent? 
- "Second-order"" participation/representation (Seifter 2016)

---
### Which rules? 
- Ones people dislike? (negativity bias)
- Controversial, salient? (both endogenous) <!-- indeed, we often measure salience this way --> 


### Which agencies? 
- Less expert, more controversial (Moore 2017)

# Why mobilize people?

### Outside lobbying
#### 1. Expand the scope of conflict (Schattschneider 1975)
vs.
#### 2. Leverage resources into an impression of public support

### 3. Not lobbying
#### Recruitment
#### Member expectations

## Political Information 

###“Coalition lobbying can generate new information and new actors—beyond simply the ‘usual suspects’—relevant to policy decision makers. Thus, we theorize **consensus**, coalition **size**, and **composition** matter to policy change." (Nelson and Yackee 2012)
---
## Measuring Political Information 

### 1. Text reuse 

### 2. Classifiers

class: inverse center middle 

# First cut

class: center

## When does mass engagment occur?
