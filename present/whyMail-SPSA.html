# Why do agencies (sometimes) get so much mail?
### Devin Judge-Lord

---














&lt;!-- 
Hi, my name is Devin Judge-Lord, I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Wisconsin
This paper is the first bit of writing I've done for my dissertation on mass engament in bureaucratic plicymaking, for example mass comment campaigns.

It sets out concepts and measures for these occasional bursts of civic participation,
which I will then use to assess it matters. 

I am still workshopping these concepts and measures, so your comments will be decisive for where I take this in the next few years. 

SLIDE 

For many reasons, Rulemaking is usually an insiders' game--people here and others have shown that, to the extent anyone is able to influence bureaucratic policymaking, it is the usual suspects, mostly businesses. 
--&gt; 

## Public comment periods:
### Usually an insiders' game, but occasionally not. 

--

&lt;!-- but SOMETIMES its very different; or at least it looks different because lots of ordinary people are voicing their opinions, but we really don't know if it matters. 
--&gt;

## Does it matter? 
![](tweet-lind.png) 

--

&lt;!-- before we can assess effects, however, we need to know what exactly we are assessing the effects OF and WHEN we expect to see these effects. This is my present task.
--&gt;

## But first:
### 1. What is it? 
### 2. How do we measure it? 
### 3. Why does it occur? (selection problems)

---
## Selection process 

### Which rules? 
- Significant, no deadline, less expert agencies (Moore n.d.)
- Ones people dislike? (negativity bias)
- Controversial, salient? (both endogenous) &lt;!-- indeed, we often measure salience this way --&gt; 

--

### -&gt; Opportunities for social movement mobilization

---

&lt;!-- First, I want to assert that what we care about here is MOBILIZED commenting. Sure a few of us in this room may peruse open dockets on regulations.gov, but this is just not what ordinary people do. By ordinary, I mean not professional policy influencers.--&gt;

#*Mobilized* civic engagement

--

### Who mobilizes?
- Public interest groups / "advocacy" groups (Shapiro 2008; Potter 2017) / "societal constituencies" (Balla et al. n.d.)

&lt;!-- Tricky concepts! --&gt;
&lt;!-- In the paper, I suggest that many conflicts that mobilize thousands are best seen as over public and private goods rather than cultural issues --&gt;

- Sometimes others &lt;!--sometimes people that don't fit that concept--&gt;

## -&gt; Coalitions



---

# Why mobilize people?

### Outside lobbying
#### 1. Expand the scope of conflict (Schattschneider 1975)
vs.
#### 2. Leverage resources into an impression of public support

### Not lobbying

#### 3. Member expectations / recruitment

# Tasks

## 1. Identify coalitions

## 2. Measure mass engagement

## 3. Which campaigns ought to matter

---

## Identifying Coalitions

### Text reuse
#### 1. Remove text copied from proposed rule or request for comments 
#### 2. Exact match = Duplicate comments 
#### 3. 10-word moving "window" = Part copy, part unique

### Word frequency
#### - K-means clustering
#### - Topic proportion similarity

### Inspect and hand-code clusters (i.e. coalitions)

&lt;!-- EPA has contractors do this by hand! --&gt; 

---
&lt;!-- Second, we need to measures what campings are doing that might be influential. I call this political information, following Nelson and Yackee  --&gt; 

## Political Information 

###“ Coalition lobbying can generate new information and new actors—beyond simply the ‘usual suspects’—relevant to policy decision makers. Thus, we theorize _**consensus**_, coalition _**size**_, and _**composition**_ matter to policy change." (Nelson and Yackee 2012)
---


## Measuring Political Information*

### - Number/share per coalition

### - Effort per comment

Lower &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt; Higher 

Duplicate (Signature) &lt;-&gt; Partially unique &lt;-&gt; Unique 

### - Potential contagion (share of unique comments?)

*Agencies may not process comments in ways that deliver this information to decisionmakers

---

## Selection issues
### Which campaigns ought to matter? 
### How to tell them apart?
--

| | Inside lobbying | Outside lobbying |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| "Normal" lobbying | High | None | 
| "Going public" | High | High |
| "Disrupting consensus" | High | Low | 
| "Going down fighting" | Low | High |

## Who mobilizes?
### A few public interest groups.

&lt;img src="https://github.com/judgelord/rulemaking/raw/master/Figs/toporgs-1.png" width = 900 /&gt;

### 100 organizations mobilized 38.7m of 48.2m regulations.gov comments on proposed rules
### ~87 lobby in public interest coalitions

## Most comments are mass comments

## When does mass engagement occur?

### Asymetric mobilization &gt; negativity bias

questions that congress scholars have asked 


EPA - profitability inseperable from democracy 

Wilson - bureaucrats want to be sued

Janna - complexity is important - working on policy development monopolies- expert groups claim rents as providing info

Brian - how important are these rules 
- 25% of CRS overturned 
- 
- payday vs. net neutrality - are they all the same thing? 
- - no some are going down fighting 
- - net neutrality is idoelogy vs ideology - organized IN THE SAME WAY 
- - payday loan was not only mobilizer - true vs false grassroots
- - disrupting consensus = Paysay 
- - why do agencies care? 

- how do they process and extract 
- - EPA consultant bins - more binned 


- better fit between theory and measures 

- Maarmam - cosigning 

- coalition - movement - interest - 
- What evidence would you need to know if this is 


Gunnar trumball - coalitions need to create legitimacy


- Companies buying off nonprofits, hiring consultants, supporting coal miners union, grass roots
