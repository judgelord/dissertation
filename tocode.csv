Dear EPA: 

In your final CO2 emissions control plan, South Carolina needs equitable treatment for its nuclear units under construction. Our utilities proactively committed to building more clean nuclear power years ago and are now constructing two new nuclear units in our state. As a South Carolinian, I am already paying for the construction of these units. Your goal is a national average 30 percent emissions reduction in CO2 emissions, and so South Carolinians should not have to pay for a 51 percent reduction in our state. Give us credit for early action on nuclear and bring our cost share closer to the national average.

Sincerely,

[Name and Address of Commenter]

This is a critical part of President Obamas plan to cut carbon pollution coming from power plants each year. With these limits we can avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change.

Carbon pollution fuels climate change, drives extreme weather, threatens communities and cuts too many lives short. I urge you to adopt this critical new standard (Docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2013-0602).

Re:	Proposed Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units

Dear Administrator McCarthy:

	The West Virginia Coal Association submits the attached comments on the federal Environmental Protection Agencys proposed standards for greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. 
The West Virginia Coal Association (WVCA) is a non-profit state coal trade association representing the interests of the West Virginia coal industry on policy and regulation issues before various state and federal agencies that regulate coal extraction, processing, transportation and consumption.  WVCAs general members account for 95 percent of the Mountain States underground and surface coal production.  WVCA also represents associate members that supply an array of services to the mining industry in West Virginia.  WVCAs primary goal is to enhance the viability of the West Virginia coal industry by supporting efficient and environmentally responsible coal removal and processing through reasonable, equitable and achievable state and federal policy and regulation.  WVCA is the largest state coal trade association in the nation.

In addition to these comments, the WVCA also adopts the comments filed by the National Mining Association and incorporates them herein by reference.  WVCA has also attached a petition containing signatures of West Virginia residents and those of other states opposing the proposed 111(d) standards 

Respectfully Submitted,

Enclosed are 93,104 individual public comments collected by CREDO Action for submission to the Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources docket. Individual comments may differ throughout, although the majority read as follows: 

Thank you for taking the long overdue step of proposing limits on carbon pollution from power-plants. Limiting carbon pollution from power plants is a crucial step to protect our health and safety. Unfortunately, these rules fall far short of what is needed. Much of the 2020 goal of 25% emissions reduction has already been achieved, leaving only an additional 5% to be achieved over 10 long years. EPA should call for more ambitious reductions of at least 40% by 2030, and insure states stick to the schedule by allowing for no extensions on plans for 2020. Global warming represents the largest single threat to our long term health and security, and demands much more aggressive action to protect our nation.

The comments have been split into 31 documents in order to facilitate uploading to the Regulations.gov website.

Administrator Gina McCarthy
Environmental Protection Agency
1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, DC  20460

Dear Administrator McCarthy: 

We the undersigned state legislators would like to applaud the Environmental Protection Agency for taking action to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change from existing power plants by at least 30 percent nationally from 2005 levels by 2030.

Clean energy is an American success story. Industry data shows it is one of the fastest growing economic sectors in the United States and already employs far more people than the coal industry. In this context, it would be very helpful for EPA to develop and distribute comparative data on the job impact of new technology development and installation versus the potential job impact of reduced use of coal.   

We believe the Clean Power Plan could achieve even more pollution reductions with higher renewable energy and energy efficiency goals for states, and we support EPA moving in that direction.

The four pillar strategy of 1) increasing generation efficiency at existing power plants by 6 percent, 2) dispatching natural gas combined cycle power plants in place of coal, 3) increasing zero-emissions power sources, and 4) relying on end-use, demand response energy efficiency programs, is a solid start to moving our nation away from being dependent on dirty energy sources. 

We appreciate the flexibility the EPA has given the states to adopt emission reduction measures other than those used to set the state targets. In addition, our ability to collaborate and develop plans on a multi-state basis, ability to choose how to meet the goal through whatever collection of measures that reflects our particular circumstances and policy objectives, and support for building on existing reduction programs, provides states the flexibility to effectively meet and hopefully exceed our carbon reduction goals.  

Democrats and Republicans are in rare agreement on the issue. A June 2014 Washington Post-ABC News Poll found 57 percent of Republicans, 76 percent of independents and 79 percent of Democrats support state-level limits on greenhouse gas emissions.

We stand ready to assist your efforts to reduce carbon dioxide pollution to protect our families, communities and nation. 

Sincerely,

(Please see attached signatures)

"139",4340347,25789,NA,NA,"Mass Comment Campaign sponsored by Environmental Action (web)","Attached you will find the comments of over 29,000 individual members of Environmental Action. Like many of these individuals, Environmental Action was excited to see President Obama call for action to limit - for the first time in US history - global warming pollution form our power sector.

This rule, and the spirit of action it embodies, are a bold and empowering sign of the President's climate leadership.

However, as you will see in many of the comments attached, many of us also feel that the EPA's interpretation of President Obama's call to action does not go far enough. In particular, the draft rules must be amended to set a higher bar for pollution reduction from the states. As drafted, many states would already exceed their targets. And we simply cannot solve climate change without more aggressive action.

Even more concerning, the draft rules use out-dated research and inaccurate assumptions to conclude that natural gas - especially gas derived from hydraulic fracturing, or fracking - is cleaner for our climate than coal. new studies clearly indicate that when the carbon impacts of methane leakage are considered, fracked gas is just as bad for the climate as coal, and can actually be WORSE in the short run. Not to mention that the EPA's own research has show that fracking contaminates groundwater, and contributes to myriad public health concerns from water pollution to increased earthquakes. It is essential, in the words of many of these individual comments - to Un-frack the clean power plan. Substituting one extreme fossil fuel for another is not the plan or action the president called for.

While many of the attached comments repeat ideas, concerns and phrases common to our members, we encourage you to treat each comment in the spirit it was submitted: as an individual perspective on the clean power rule, each action contains it's own subject referencing the correct Docket number. Our choice to compile comments into a series of consolidated documents does not mean you should count all 29,000+ messages attached as one 'comment'. While rule making need not be based on a public vote, each of these citizens wants and deserves to be heard. Please treat their concerns as such.

Again, thank you for this strong step in the right direction to stop global warming. Don't stop here, consider these comments and as you write the final rules, please take the advice of these many thousands of Americans and strengthen them.

I am writing to deliver the public comments of 4,010 Americans regarding Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0660. Collected by Change.org on behalf of CREDO Action, all listed signatories have signed onto the following comment: 

“Regulating greenhouse gas pollution from power plants to mitigate the disastrous impacts of climate change is one of the most urgent matters before the EPA.

But the proposed new source rule for greenhouse gas pollution, while symbolically important, falls far short of what is needed. It is clearly weak in many respects including the following:

1) It doesn't change the facts on the ground but merely codifies them -- construction of new coal plants has already been halted by the hard work of community and environmental activists along with the rising cost of coal and low natural gas prices.

2) It contains massive loopholes including the exemption for biomass, the one year grace period for new plants that will be exempt from the rules, and allowing new coal plants to pollute for ten years if they plan to install CCS.

3) The carbon pollution limit for new power plants - 1,000 pounds of CO2 per megawatt hour of energy produced -- is low enough to limit new coal fired power plants, but high enough not to affect natural gas plants.

Don't bow to pressure from climate denying extremists or fossil fuel propagandists who are a literal threat to our future survival. I urge you to strengthen the new source carbon pollution standard and immediately implement a strong rule to limit carbon pollution from existing sources.

No matter how extreme and anti-science the political climate, nothing less than bold action is required to fight climate change, one of the most urgent challenges facing us as a nation and a planet.”

Dear Administrator Jackson: 
RE: Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0660

I support the Environmental Protection Agency’s efforts to clean up power plant carbon pollution because it will protect public health and set the stage for the next generation of America’s power plants to be the cleanest and most modern in the world. 

Scientists warn that the buildup of carbon pollution will create warmer temperatures which could lead to higher smog levels. More smog means more childhood asthma attacks and complications for others with lung disease. Healthy air is important to me. 

Please issue final rules before the end of 2012. 

Thank you.

But the proposed new source rule for greenhouse gas pollution, while symbolically important, falls far short of what is needed. It is clearly weak in many respects including the following:

1) It doesn't change the facts on the ground but merely codifies them -- construction of new coal plants has already been halted by the hard work of community and environmental activists along with the rising cost of coal and low natural gas prices.

2) It contains massive loopholes including the exemption for biomass, the one year grace period for new plants that will be exempt from the rules, and allowing new coal plants to pollute for ten years if they plan to install CCS.

3) The carbon pollution limit for new power plants - 1,000 pounds of CO2 per megawatt hour of energy produced -- is low enough to limit new coal fired power plants, but high enough not to affect natural gas plants.

Don't bow to pressure from climate denying extremists or fossil fuel propagandists who are a literal threat to our future survival. I urge you to strengthen the new source carbon pollution standard and immediately implement a strong rule to limit carbon pollution from existing sources.

No matter how extreme and anti-science the political climate, nothing less than bold action is required to fight climate change, one of the most urgent challenges facing us as a nation and a planet.”

The potential for these new regulations to dramatically raise energy prices and cost thousands of hard-working American jobs is too great.
 
These new plans to regulate power plants don’t work for my family, my community or our nation’s economy.

“Thank you for proposing limits to industrial carbon pollution from future power plants. I strongly support the Environmental Protection Agency's action on climate change. 

We have an obligation to protect our future generations from climate change by addressing its causes and impacts including carbon pollution from power plants. 

Power plants account for 40% of the carbon pollution in the United States, and while we currently protect public health with limits on arsenic, lead, soot and other pollution from power plants, there are no existing federal limits on carbon pollution.

Please move quickly on finalizing the new carbon pollution standards to ensure no future power plants can dump unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the air and stick to your commitment to cut the pollution from existing plants that drives climate change.”

Dear Administrator McCarthy,

The Administration has repeatedly said that it supports an ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy. Electric co-ops have pursued ""all-of-the-above"" by spending billions on innovative, clean and efficient technologies.

But the EPA's proposal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions at new power plants seems to be an ""all-but-one"" approach.

I'm a member of my local not-for-profit electric cooperative/PPD and this rule has me really concerned. In uncertain economic times, I urge the Administration to stick by its ""all-of-the-above"" promise.

Administrator McCarthy, please withdraw this proposal and work with electric cooperatives on a common sense solution that balances energy needs and environmental concerns.

Sincerely,

America's Electric Cooperatives

We need strong rules to limit carbon pollution -- not only from new, unbuilt power plants but especially from the existing power plants whose pollution is heating up our atmosphere right now. The administration needs to stop dragging its feet and immediately implement the strong rules that we desperately need.”

I am deeply concerned about the effects of climate change, especially in the wake of extreme weather events that are fueled by a warming world -- stronger hurricanes, unprecedented flooding, and raging wildfires. 

The Clean Power Plan is the most significant federal action to mitigate climate change. We must not change it. If anything, it should be made stronger to even better protect the health of our families and communities. Actions that limit carbon pollution from coal power plants don't just help us fight climate change; they also reduce other harmful emissions that jeopardize human health. The Clean Power Plan would have reduced carbon emissions from the electricity sector by 32 percent, avoided 90,000 asthma attacks per year, and prevented 3,200 premature deaths per year by 2030. 

Dismantling the Clean Power Plan, as you are proposing to do, puts the health and well-being of our communities -- especially communities of color and low-income families that bear the brunt of climate impacts -- further at risk. Millions of Americans count on the government to help protect them from climate change and public health disasters. This is one of those moments: Please do not replace the Clean Power Plan with this unlawful and unacceptable proposal.

As devastating heat waves, hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts have made the reality of the climate crisis so painfully clear, The Climate Reality Project and our supporters know that its time to promote common sense solutions over the interests of big polluters. The Clean Power Plan was a landmark rule to keep our air clean and fight climate change, but your proposed replacement is bad for our health, our jobs, and the climate. We oppose this attempt to replace the Clean Power Plan with the Affordable Clean Energy Rule,  more accurately called the Dirty Power Scam.  

The Dirty Power Scam puts Big Polluters over people. It allows the fossil fuel industry to keep pumping more and more pollution into our atmosphere, exacerbating the climate crisis and leaving American families to pay the price in premature deaths, asthma, and so much more.  Instead of trying to prop up the struggling coal industry, America should be supporting the clean energy jobs of the future. In fact, there are already 3.2 million clean energy jobs and growing in the US today. The EPA must act to protect the health and economic vitality of America. 

The 13,123 comments attached reflect signatures gathered online from our supporters across the country demanding that the EPA not replace the Clean Power Plan with the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, as stated by this language presented to signees:

""We strongly oppose replacing the Clean Power Plan with the weaker Affordable Clean Energy Rule.

Poll after poll shows that the overwhelming majority of Americans want the government to confront the climate crisis head-on by shifting from dirty fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. When EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan, over 4.3 million Americans spoke up to support it. 

The message couldnt be any clearer: We want a clean energy economy. 

The Clean Power Plan is an example of the federal government listening to the American people and taking action. By replacing it with this new, weaker rule, we allow carbon pollution and toxic emissions from the power sector to continue driving climate change and causing health issues for the most vulnerable among us. And we compromise the continued growth of the booming clean energy and efficiency industry that already employs 3.2 million Americans  more than oil, coal, and gas combined.

The EPAs mission is to protect human health and the environment  and we need acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler to live up to that solemn responsibility.

A clean energy economy is good for our planet, our families, and our health. We strongly oppose replacing the Clean Power Plan with this weaker rule and call on EPA to act on climate for the sake of all Americans.""

The Climate Reality Project and its many supporters demand that the Environmental Protection Agency live up to its mission of protecting our health and our planet by protecting and strengthening the Clean Power Plan, not replacing it with the Dirty Power Scam.

Ken Berlin

As a young American, I am writing today deeply concerned by the EPA's proposal to ""replace"" the Clean Power Plan. This proposal does not protect American communities from dangerous pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that exacerbate climate change.

Our communities are already facing the impacts of climate change, from near-unstoppable wildfires to extreme flooding to dangerous super-storms. These impacts are only getting worse. And my generation will bear the brunt of the damage.

We deserve a Clean Power Plan that will significantly reduce carbon pollution and pollution that has negative health impacts for American communities. This is no time to move backwards on climate protections. 

This proposal does not go far enough to protect our communities, our health, and our planet.

"457",1683384,11943,NA,NA,"Mass Comment Campaign sponsored by Environment America (Web)","Dear Administrator Wheeler,
 
I write today on behalf of Environment Americas members and supporters across the country who want clean air and a healthy climate. We strongly oppose the administrations attempts to repeal and replace the Clean Power Plan. 
 
The original Clean Power Plan was designed to cut air pollution and help prevent the worsening impacts of climate change. However, the suggested replacement would do just the opposite.
 
If fully implemented, the Clean Power Plan would have eliminated 32 percent of the carbon pollution from the electric power sector by 2030 with huge corresponding health and environmental benefits. Instead, the administration aims to keep dirty coal plants online longer and increase carbon emissions, at a time when scientists are telling us we must reduce this pollution quickly to stave off catastrophic impacts of global warming.
 
Instead of working as hard as we can to reduce carbon pollution from our power plants to prevent even worse impacts, the administrations plan promises to set us back. We expect this plan to flatline or even allow an increase in the burning of dirty, dangerous fossil fuels and stymie the transition of the power sector to clean, renewable energy.
 
Increasing greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels like coal and natural gas will further exacerbate global warming and destabilize the climate. Given the urgency of the climate challenge we need national programs that will accelerate the reduction of carbon emissions. The Clean Power Plan didnt come out of thin air  EPA conducted extensive public outreach and solicited stakeholder feedback from every corner of the country. It is based on a strong legal foundation  consistent with the law, earlier court precedents, and other EPA standards that protect Americans from dangerous pollution. Americans have sent more than 8 million comments to EPA in support of standards limiting carbon pollution from new and existing power plants, the most ever received by the agency. 

By 2030, the Clean Power Plan would prevent as many as 4,500 premature deaths each year, along with 90,000 asthma attacks and 300,000 missed work and school days. Replacing the Clean Power Plan with this weaker version will mean more sick kids, more expensive hospital visits, and thousands of premature deaths that could have been prevented  and could lead to more intense and destructive severe weather events.


Dismantling the Clean Power Plan poses grave risks to citizens and communities across the United States. Ignoring air pollution wont make our country great for kids with asthma or older Americans who struggle to breathe. Ignoring climate change wont make American families safe from storms powered by oceans that are rising and growing warmer or wildfires fueled by hotter temperatures. When it comes to global warming, the EPA needs to accept the science, recognize the reality, and put the health and well being of Americans first. 

Environment Americas recent study, Trouble in the Air, shows that as of 2016, 73 million Americans experienced more than 100 days of degraded air quality in 2016, and the impacts of unhealthy air are being worsened by climate change. To safeguard public health, the nation needs to preserve and strengthen existing air quality protections at the federal and state level and move to reduce the future air pollution threats posed by global warming.

The nations power sector is on track to meet the goals of the Clean Power Plan. In fact, by the end of 2018, emissions are projected to be down by 28%, closing in on the the overall goal of 32% by 2030 earlier than expected. Several states are already cutting power plant pollution by capping emissions through innovative programs like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. But this move will reverse progress on carbon reductions. We need to have the Clean Power Plan as a backstop that guarantees continued progress toward cleaner power plants - progress that is by no means certain without it. A strong Clean Power Plan can also lay the groundwork for the even more dramatic emission reductions that will be needed from the power sector in the years and decades to come.

Environment America is submitting 11,940 comments today in support of a strong Clean Power Plan. We ask that these names be entered into the official record and considered as separate public comments.

No one wants more pollution, more illness, and more deaths from burning dirty fossil fuels, yet that is exactly what well get from this new proposed rule. The EPAs mission is to protect our environment and our health. The administration needs to stop this rollback and get back to work doing just that.

Andrea McGimsey

We need swift, responsible action to ensure a safe and stable climate, not the pro-coal plan that you are proposing.

It is your job to ensure Americans and all wildlife have clean air, land and water. Climate change poses an unprecedented threat to all and requires action to cut the pollution causing it.

The Clean Power Plan was the greatest step the U.S. has ever taken to reduce carbon pollution. The plan would have furthered the already booming clean energy economy, created more jobs, driven American ingenuity and helped to secure a bright future for wildlife and our communities. Your decision to repeal this rule and replace it with the ""Affordable Clean Energy"" rule is a serious mistake. The agency's own analysis shows the rule could result in thousands of additional premature deaths each year from increased coal use and pollution, not to mention untold climate effects. 

Reconsider your actions and implement the original Clean Power Plan, which would actually reduce harmful carbon pollution from power plants. Drop your plan to repeal the Clean Power Plan, and do not magnify the harm by implementing a pro-coal rule that puts people and wildlife at risk. Toss the pro-coal plan and do your job.

Like you, Environmental Action wants the public record of the decision making process on changes to mercury emissions guidelines to be as complete and accurate as possible. To that end, we ask that these comments be placed in the public record and considered in your planning.

In Maine, climate change is not just a looming threat - we can see its impacts already. That is why Maine people, and people across the country, are supporting the Clean Power Plan (CPP) to take action and mitigate the devastating consequences of climate change. 

The CPP would drastically reduce carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants and push for renewable energy sources that support a clean energy future and economy. Americans overwhelmingly support the CPP - and Mainers are no different -  because we know that it's time for our country to take serious steps to protect our public health, natural resources, and future from the growing threats of climate change.
 
Maine depends on its abundant natural resources to fuel our state's economy, and climate change is already taking a toll on the industries that Maine's economy depends on, from lobster fisheries to moose populations. Furthermore, Maine sits at the tailpipe of the nation: even though Maine is not home to any coal-fired power plants, Maine has one of the highest rates of asthma in the country because we breathe in the pollution from power plants in western states. We need federal policy like the CPP to make sure that the air we breathe and the water we drink in Maine remains clean and healthy for future generations. 

We expect you to defend our environmental and public health by protecting the Clean Power Plan and moving our nation forward instead of backwards. 

Signed,

The 663 Maine people listed in the attached file.

Dear Administrator Pruitt, 

On behalf of Clean Water Action, I am submitting 4,455 letters from our members urging you to drop your plan to repeal the Clean Power Plan. The CPP is our most serious attempt to fight climate change and protect public health. By repealing the Plan you are putting profits for fossil fuel companies before the needs of our families and public health.

The Clean Power Plan is projected to prevent 90,000 asthma attacks, 300,000 missed work and school days, and 3,600 premature deaths annually by 2030. Repealing these standards means more sick kids, more expensive hospital visits, and thousands of premature deaths that could have been prevented. There is no way to justify this decision.

While you have been working to dismantle action on climate, supercharged hurricanes and climate fueled wildfires are ravaging our communities and killing Americans. Climate change is real. Its happening now. And EPA is required by law to address it.

States, cities, and businesses across the country are moving forward with clean energy solutions that reduce air and carbon pollution and grow the clean energy economy, creating good-paying American jobs. Repealing the Clean Power Plan will create uncertainty and put these solutions at risk.

Please drop this reckless proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan.

Sincerely, 
Andrew Grinberg, National Campaigns Special Projects Manager

Dear Administrator Pruitt,

The Clean Power Plan is our nation's best tool to reduce carbon pollution from power plants, combat climate change and protect our health. Analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency finds that the Clean Power Plan could prevent the premature deaths of as many as 4,500 Americans per year by 2030. Americans deserve clean air to breathe and a safe future for our children. I urge you to protect our climate and our health by keeping the Clean Power Plan intact.We urge you to move forward with federal standards to limit dangerous global warming pollution and protect our health.

Dear Administrator Pruitt,

This cover letter accompanies the 4,408 comments we received from people across the country who wanted to speak out in support of the Clean Power Plan. 

Green For All works to build an inclusive green economy strong enough to lift people out of poverty. Our goals are to make sure that:
People of color have a place and voice in the climate movement
Our neighborhoods are strong, resilient and healthy, and
The growing clean energy economy brings jobs and opportunity to our communities. 

The Trump Administrations proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan is a direct assault on our lives and childrens futures. Dismantling the first and only federal limits on carbon pollution from existing power plants wont help vulnerable families breathe. Power plant pollution is sending people who live near them to the hospital, with breathing problems.

Power plants should not be allowed to pollute our communities as much as they want. Polluters routinely target communities of color and low-income communities for their dirtiest projects. Families living and working at the frontlines of pollution have been paying the health, economic, and climate costs for generations while fossil fuel companies have enjoyed record profits. Its time to reverse the trend.  

In addition to curbing air pollution, the Clean Power Plan is essential to meeting our climate goals. The vast majority of the comments we received agree that setting strict carbon pollution regulations for power plants through the Clean Power Plan is good for the environment and the economy.  

On behalf of Green For All, and on behalf of our more than 4,408 members who submitted enclosed public comments, please do NOT eliminate or weaken the Clean Power Plan in any way.

Thank you.

The EPA's dangerous decision to repeal America's Clean Power Plan is an insult to current and future Americans. Our children, grandchildren, and those to follow are counting on us to lead in the fight against climate change, which threatens the health and future of my children.

As a parent, I am concerned about the health impacts of climate change and air pollution. America's Clean Power Plan would offer significant health benefits to Americans. It would avoid thousands of premature deaths each year as a result of reductions in particle pollution, and prevent 90,000 asthma attacks each year, yielding tens of billions of dollars in annual health benefits. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have expressed support for the plan, along with Democrats and Republicans alike, cities and communities, religious leaders and businesses. 

I implore the EPA--as America's first defender against toxic pollution and climate-changing pollutants--to institute a plan that will take seriously these threats and do all it can to keep American families safe and healthy.

Attached please find 60,593 comments collected online by CREDO Action in regard to the EPA's proposed change to the Clean Power Plan.
Individual comments may differ throughout, although the majority read as follows: 
""The Environmental Protection Agency has a legal responsibility to protect Americans from the catastrophic effects of carbon pollution. The Clean Power Plan is a critical first step in addressing these effects. Rather than repealing it, the EPA must preserve, enforce and strengthen the Clean Power Plan to protect public health and the environment from climate change.""

I am deeply concerned that the Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to delay implementation of key parts of the methane new and modified source rule for two years, and may be seeking to permanently undo the rule entirely.  I urge you to withdraw this proposed suspension and immediately begin putting the methane rule into effect.

Methane is a super-pollutant that speeds climate change in the short-term, imperiling pronghorn and other wildlife and special places that are important to me and to our nation as a whole.  The oil and gas industry is the single largest source of this pollution in the U.S., and companies are not doing enough to keep excessive methane pollution from flaring and leaking into the atmosphere.  Also, toxic and smog-forming pollution is released along with the methane pollution, making local pollution problems worse and threatening my family's health.

As Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, your duty is to protect public health and welfare and the environment from undue harm. My family, wildlife, and natural treasures should not have to pay the price for pollution that could be reduced by a more responsible industry. EPA sometimes has to press industry to clean up, and this is one of those times.

I urge you to withdraw the methane rule suspension and immediately begin putting it into effect.

Docket ID: EPA-HQ-OAR-2010-0505 

I strongly oppose the EPA's proposal to delay the implementation of critical methane pollution standards. The EPA should be leading efforts to protect our planet and our health, not rolling back important regulations on oil and gas industry pollution.

The EPA's mission is to protect human health and the environment -- not corporate polluters' profits. It is especially indefensible that the EPA would propose this order when the agency has even admitted that ""the environmental health or safety risk addressed by this action may have a disproportionate effect on children.""

It is EPA's obligation to protect all Americans from harmful pollution like methane. This attempt to dismantle standards that protect us from oil and a gas industry pollution is nothing less than a direct assault on our health and environment. EPA stands for Environmental Protection Agency, not Environmental Pollution Agency. Please fulfill your mission and keep this important methane rule in place.","Oil and Natural Gas Sector -- New Source Performance Standards, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, and Control Techniques Guidelines"

Enforce the methane pollution standards that keep our air clean and our families safe and health (Re: EPA-HQ-OAR-2010-0505-7736)

Dear Administrator Pruitt,

I oppose this move to delay the implementation of methane pollution standards. Rather than stay these critical protections for any amount of time, we need the EPA to strengthen methane pollution safeguards.

Americans depend on the EPA to protect us from the harmful pollution that makes it harder to breathe and the corporate polluters who profit from it. We need the EPA to fulfill its mission to ""protect human health and the environment"" by not letting corporate polluters play fast and loose with our children's health.

Leaks from shoddy, broken equipment are among the largest sources of methane and other harmful pollutants from oil and gas facilities. But the leak detection and repair standards in this rule will deliver up to 45 percent of target reductions in smog- and soot-forming volatile organic compounds and nearly all target reductions in hazardous air pollutants such as cancer-causing benzene and formaldehyde.

Delaying this rule will irreparably harm millions of Americans who live in close proximity to the more than 18,000 new and modified wells--more than 11,000 of which are located in states that do not impose their own comparable leak detection and repair programs.

It is the EPA's obligation to protect all Americans from harmful methane pollution. Any attempt to slow or dismantle standards that reduce pollution emitted from the oil and gas industry is a direct assault on our health and environment and the Environmental Protection Agency should not be complicit.

Sincerely,

""I am writing today in strong opposition to your proposal to suspend vital air pollution safeguards that will reduce harmful methane, smog-forming volatile organic compounds, and toxic air pollutants like benzene from new and modified sources in the oil and natural gas sector. 

As a parent and a member of Moms Clean Air Force, I am concerned about how pollution from the oil and gas industry affects children's health. Methane leaks make smog worse, contribute to global climate change, and waste money. And where methane is leaking, so are carcinogenic compounds like benzene and other VOCs. I don't want those in the air our kids breathe.
 
The health-protective methane standards were developed through extensive public input and years of agency deliberation. There is no basis for EPA to suspend these safeguards. We need the EPA to fulfill its mission to ""protect human health and the environment"" by not letting corporate polluters play fast and loose with our children's health.

Please reconsider this dangerous proposal, and ensure these crucial pollution safeguards remain in place.""

Dear Administrator Pruitt,   

EPA Proposed Rule: Oil and Natural Gas Sector; Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources: 
Stay of Certain Requirements  Docket # EPA-HQ-OAR-2010-0505 

I am writing on behalf of United Methodist Women (UMW), the largest denominational faith-based organization for women with
approximately 800,000 members, to oppose EPA's proposed two-year stay, and any stay of any duration, of the new source
performance standards for the oil and gas sector, 40 C.F.R. subpart OOOOa.  
 
We appreciate the opportunity to submit public comments, and United Methodist Women nation-wide have expressed their
opposition to the two-year or postponement of the June 2016 rule that requires manufactures of natural gas and oil to adhere 
to strict performance standards on ""fugitive emissions"" at well sites and compressor stations and emissions from pneumatic
pumps.  Attached are individual letters from United Methodists Women members and friends that were compiled through our
web portal.  

We strongly urge you to adhere to the rule's requirements and not attempt to stay those provisions.  
 
You can contact Elizabeth Lee to further discuss this request. Please see contact information below.

To Whom It May Concern:

Please find 15,023 comments attached for inclusion in this docket, EPA-HQ-OAR-2010-0505-12363, ""Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources; Grant of Reconsideration and Partial Stay"" regarding the proposed stay of EPA's methane emission standards. 1780 people have taken the time to write a personalized comment and all 15,023 have signed to the following text:

""I oppose any delay in the implementation of EPA's methane pollution standards. Staying these protections will put our environment and public health at risk. If anything, EPA should strengthen the methane pollution safeguards. We depend on EPA to protect us from harmful pollution that makes it harder to breathe, aggravates asthma, warms our climate, and fills our air with toxic compounds. EPA must fulfill its mission to ""protect human health and the environment"" by maintaining and enforcing these standards and protecting our health. 

Furthermore, the proposed change in the social cost of methane simply doesn't make any sense and disregards basic science and economics. When greenhouse gases like methane are released they don't just stay over the U.S., they warm the entire planet, so we can't create policies that only look at the impacts on the U.S. In addition, EPA's new ""interim domestic"" social cost wrongly and severely discounts the needs of future generations compared to earlier and more accurate versions of the social cost of methane. 

EPA has an obligation to protect all Americans from harmful methane pollution and other emissions from the oil and gas sector. Any attempt to slow or dismantle standards that cut pollution from the oil and gas industry is a direct assault on our health. EPA must therefore abandon its proposal to stay these standards and continue to enforce them without delay.""

Thank you for addressing methane pollution (RE: Docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2010-0505 FRL-9929-75-OAR)

Dear Administrator McCarthy,

For too long, the oil and gas industry has been allowed to leak millions of tons of methane and other toxic chemicals into the air. No one should have to fear that the air they are breathing might be a threat to their health or the health of their loved ones. That's why I support a strong methane pollution standard and want to thank the EPA for its work to meet President Obama's goal of reducing methane pollution from oil and gas operations 40 to 45 percent by 2025.

While this proposal is an important and necessary first step, to meet that goal, the EPA must quickly begin the process of addressing existing sources and requiring all companies--even those that are already doing well--to regularly check for leaks.

Taking steps to cut these emissions makes sense for our health and for our planet, which is already suffering from the impacts of climate change. The Methane Pollution Standard is a sensible, cost-effective proposal to continue addressing the climate crisis and decrease health risks to our children and families.

To: EPA

I urge the Environmental Protection Agency to issue strong rules to curb methane and other harmful air pollution from oil and gas development (EPA-HQ-OAR-2010-0505 and EPA-HQ-OAR-2013-0685). While no amount of regulation can make fracked gas a clean energy source, I support efforts to capture methane, repair leaks, and aggregate disparate sources of methane and other air pollution along the oil and gas supply chain. These important pollution controls will not only help stave off catastrophic climate change but also protect communities from harm imposed by the oil and gas industry.

I urge you to improve the proposed rules to include

Several key pieces of equipment that were omitted from the proposal that emit methane and harmful VOCs.
Storage vessels that were covered under the VOC standards but are not included in the methane proposal.
Liquids-unloading operations.
Pneumatic controllers that operate on an intermittent or snap-acting basis.
Compressors at well sites.
Mandatory inspections at least quarterly or monthly (rather than a default semiannual requirement), which should remain at a fixed frequency rather than decreasing on low-leak-rate detection.
Shortening the time source operators have to repair leaking equipment if it would be unsafe to make the repair within 15 days of discovery.
Defining ""sources"" to include functionally interrelated equipment so regulators can aggregate individual emissions sources to prevent significant deterioration of our air quality.
Including communities in the pollution-detection process. A citizen complaint system is needed to allow communities living near fracked gas infrastructure to alert the EPA if they detect odors or air pollution events nearby.
Requiring oil and gas companies to use or bring to market captured gas, rather than flare it, unless extraordinary circumstances make flaring unavoidable.

In addition to these important changes to strengthen the proposals, I urge the EPA to regulate existing sources of methane pollution under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. Voluntary standards are insufficient to cut harmful, climate-disrupting methane pollution from oil and gas operations, and they will not adequately protect affected communities. To safeguard communities living with the burden of existing oil and gas infrastructure and to meet President Obama's Climate Action Plan goal of reducing oil and gas sector methane emissions 40 to 45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025, the EPA must move quickly to create rules for existing oil and gas facilities upstream, midstream, and downstream.

I support the EPA's proposals as a means to begin to address the climate crisis exacerbated by the fracking boom and reduce harm to communities living with the burden of the oil and gas industry. I urge the EPA to make the changes needed to ensure that these rules are sufficiently strong to protect public health and tackle climate change. Regulating existing sources of air pollution, coupled with an immediate shift to an economy that depends on clean, renewable energynot fossil fuelsare steps that must be followed to avoid the most devastating effects of catastrophic climate change.

The bulk of the comments are as follows:

I support the EPA's proposed rules to reduce methane pollution from the oil and gas industry.  

These pollution limits will help to address climate change and its associated impacts to wildlife and people by curtailing methane pollution, which is an especially potent greenhouse gas. The methane limits will also help prevent other dangerous pollutants and habitat degradation caused by industrial oil and gas development. 

Cutting methane pollution is also a vital piece of the President's Climate Action Plan, along with the Clean Power Plan and other important measures to limit carbon pollution.  

Please strengthen the methane rule by expanding its scope to include additional important emissions sources, mandate a higher frequency of repairing methane leaks, ensure that companies capture gas rather than flaring it, and move quickly to expand the EPA methane rule to cover existing oil and gas infrastructure.

The names of NWF Action Fund supporters who have submitted comments are attached.

I strongly support the EPA's proposal to establish new controls on hazardous air emissions from oil and gas operations.  These new safeguards are long overdue and will responsibly protect our air quality from the millions of tons of pollution the oil and gas industry produces every year.  

Please strengthen the air emissions rules over the current proposal by:

      - Requiring this rule to target direct methane reductions and controls;
       -Specifically addressing the dangerous air pollutant hydrogen sulfide;
      - Ending the  industry's common practice of ""flaring"" or burning-off un-captured gas;
       -Requiring the use of best available technology in all oil and gas operations;
       -Improving monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements;
       -Regulating all significant emissions sources like surface ""frac pits.""

Addressing air emissions from hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking"" operations is essential. Each year the industry fracks more than 25,000 wells nationwide that emit tons of the incredibly potent greenhouse gas methane, smog-causing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and known carcinogens like benzene into our air.

I urge the EPA to quickly promulgate strong air protections  without delay. ","Oil and Natural Gas Sector -- New Source Performance Standards, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, and Control Techniques Guidelines"

Dear Administrator Jackson:

Attached you will find 58,678 public comment submissions in support of the Proposed Rule on Oil and Natural Gas Sector: New Source Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants Reviews. Though the comments vary slightly from person to person, the majority read as follows:

“Thank you for proposing new rules to limit toxic air emissions from oil and gas operations. 

The proposed rules are fair, achievable and vitally important given that regulations to protect our air from oil and gas drilling have not kept up with the rapid pace of drilling expansion.

In addition to reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds, your agency should limit emissions of methane, a potent heat-trapping gas that leads to global warming. Your agency also needs to strengthen the limits of hazardous air pollutants and cancer-causing chemicals like benzene to fulfill your legal duty to protect communities from unacceptable health threats like toxic air pollution coming from the oil and gas sector.”

These comments have been collected by CREDO Action and submitted to you on behalf of 58,678 members across the country. To see the individual comments and the names of the people who submitted them, please download the attached PDF. This is the first of 11 attachments.

If you have any questions about this petition or the attached comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.

The re-introduction of wolves into our environment is a cause for celebration, not a reason to re-open hunting. And until the last few years, this iconic species was one of the great triumphs of the Endangered Species Act. Leading scientists have found again and again that wolves and other top predators are an essential part of a healthy ecosystem. And millions of Americans and tourists are drawn to these powerful, inspiring, and too-often misunderstood creatures.

And now, the FWS's own independent review from UC Santa Barbara has unanimously concluded that the proposal is not based on the best available science and that FWS's own research is filled with numerous omissions and errors. 

A few months ago, Sec. Jewell said of the proposed rule that it was ""not [her] call,"" because ""you do what the science says."" With the release of this study and the thousands of comments attached, science and the pubic have spoken: You must retain federal protections for wolves in the lower 48 states.

Subject: Gray Wolf Delisting (proposed rule) – comments
Docket ID: FWS-HQ-ES-2013-0073-43030


Dear Secretary Jewell,

Please accept these comments and those recently submitted from the Endangered Species Coalition (ESC) concerning the proposed rule to remove the gray wolf from the list of threatened & endangered species (but to maintain endangered status for the Mexican wolf). ESC represents over 300 member groups and tens of thousands of supporters who share our mission to protect and restore our nations most imperiled wildlife.  Our members have been deeply involved in wolf recovery efforts across the country. These 18,490 comments are in addition to those submitted in the earlier comment periods. Please also see submitted video comments from young people around the country at http://www.endangered.org/kids-to-secretary-jewell-follow-the-science/ and  http://www.endangered.org/its-about-science/

The Endangered Species Coalition and our members and supporters remain strongly opposed to the proposed rule. We urge FWS to immediately withdraw the rule and continue protections for wolves across the lower-48 states. 

The news that the peer review panel has rejected the science used in writing this proposed rule is the most glaring of what are many reasons to reject this plan. The Service's questionable scientific reasoning and unwarranted political calculus necessitate a complete retraction of this proposal and thorough investigation prior to any similar proposals.

Wolves are still recovering in states around the country and trying desperately to expand into others. Removing Endangered Species Act protections now would threaten this recovery and potentially weaken the Endangered Species Act.

In addition, states are not prepared to take on the responsibility of recovery of a delisted population of wolves.  We urge FWS not to back away from federal recovery and allow scenarios like what is happening in Idaho to occur in other states.  

In Idaho, efforts to kills wolves have ramped up significantly. Year-round hunting and trapping is now allowed in parts of the state, government-paid trappers have been active in Wilderness areas, and a bill continues to move forward that would spend $2 million to kill most of the wolves in the state. Idaho's management plans fail to demonstrate adequate regulatory mechanisms are in place as required by the ESA post-delisting.

In other states; Washington’s wolf recovery trend seems to have stalled in 2014, California has
stubbornly refused to protect wolves, and in Oregon continued poaching, an outbreak of
parvovirus, and a continued campaign of misinformation continue to put wolf recovery
on shaky ground.

In light of these facts and the rejection of this rule by the peer review panel, I urge that the Service immediately withdraw this plan.

Sincerely,


Leda Huta
Executive Director

Dear US Fish and Wildlife Service,

Care2 members wanted to comment on the Proposed Rule: Removing the Gray Wolf (Canis lupus) from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Maintaining Protections for the Mexican Wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) by Listing It as Endangered.

Here is the letter from the Defenders of Wildlife petition on Care2's petition site that our members signed urging you not to delist wolves:

--------------------------------

Dear [decision maker],

I am writing to oppose the move to delist wolves from the Endangered Species Act.

Gray wolf recovery is not complete. This decision could derail wolf recovery efforts in areas around the country where it has barely begun -- in places like the Pacific Northwest and in states that possess some of the nation's best unoccupied wolf habitat, such as northern California, Colorado, and Utah.

Delisting would prematurely turn wolf management over to the states. We've already seen what can happen when rabid anti-wolf politics are allowed to trump science and core wildlife management principles.

Montana, Wyoming and Idaho -- where wolves have already been delisted -- are not managing wolves like other wildlife such as elk, deer, and bears. Instead they're intending to drive the wolves' population numbers back down to the bottom.

Other species, such as the bald eagle, American alligator, and peregrine falcon were declared recovered and delisted when they occupied a much larger portion of their former range. Wolves deserve the same chance at real recovery.

I urge you to continue to protect wolves under the Endangered Species Act.

I write today in response to the rule proposed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management governing hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" on public lands. The current proposal out for public comment is severely inadequate, and in its current form will fail to protect either public health or the environment.

This controversial oil and gas development technique--in which drillers blast millions of gallons of chemically treated water into the earth to force gas from underground deposits--has been linked to air and water pollution and public health problems. In its current form, the proposal fails to stem these problems.

In its latest proposal, the BLM fails to propose adequate well construction and integrity standards. A key test to ensure drinking water sources are properly isolated from the well was dropped. Now a test to ensure proper cementing will be required on only one ""type well"" and the data from that well used to approve others. Such a procedure invites companies to develop one model well and then to cut corners on the rest. Industry should have to demonstrate the integrity of every well.

The draft requires companies to disclose chemical constituents in fracking fluids, after fracking is complete. Disclosure should occur both before and after fracking, in order to give nearby communities time to establish baseline water quality and then test and monitor water supplies for any fracking-related water pollution. States including Wyoming already require pre-fracking disclosure, so the BLM proposal should go at least this far.

The proposal also signals the use of FracFocus as the tool for disclosure. In its current form, FracFocus is insufficient. It's an industry-funded database that fails to allow users to search across forms or aggregate data from multiple wells. To ensure data is complete, adequate and available, the BLM should have its own website for this information reporting, complete with the ability to search and aggregate data.

The president promised in his State of the Union that this country's gas drilling boom would not come at the expense of public health. As it stands now, the proposed rule fails to meet that promise.","Oil and Gas; Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands"

I am calling for a ban on fracking on all federal lands.

Californians deserve to have their public lands managed for the good of the people. These precious wilderness areas belong to us, not the oil and gas industry.

The Bureau of Land Management's proposed rules for regulated hydraulic fracturing on Federal and Native American lands are not only weak, but they do not take into account all the harmful processes required to frack for oil and gas.

Our forests are for hiking, not for fracking.

Born and raised in Los Angeles, I cherish the mountain ranges that surround me. Not only are they a gorgeous backdrop to my city, but they provide a unique way of life. I have fond memories of hiking with my family, cliff jumping into deep pools of icy water with friends, and taking long drives through the Angeles National Forest on the CA-2.

President Obama wants to increase fracking on federal public lands as part of his climate solution, but that plan would only create more problems.

In California, this would open up the Angeles National Forest, the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and the Los Padres National Forest to fracking, and could impact Kings Canyon National Park and Sequoia National Park. The fracking industry will destroy our roads and infrastructure, clear our forests and habitats, threaten wildlife and increase air pollution.

Hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" injects millions of gallons of fracking fluids — a mixture of nearly 600 chemicals, water and sand — into a well to create pressure that cracks open rocks underground, releasing natural gas and oil.

Help protect California's national parks and open spaces from fracking.

Fracking and unconventional gas and oil extraction is inherently dangerous, and cannot be regulated, and therefore should be banned on federal lands, and everywhere else. Toxic energy policies with catastrophic climate change implications have no place in our energy future!

The Obama Administration recently proposed new, woefully inadequate, rules for oil and gas fracking on federal lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management. By doing so, the BLM will pave the way for drillers to amass corporate profits at the expense of our American treasures and essential resources.

Stand with the people of New York in calling for a National Ban by signing this petition to submit comments under protest for drilling on public lands. No amount of rules will fix the industry's well-documented chronic well casing failures, nor mitigate the gross amount of chemicals, volatile organic compounds, or methane contamination in groundwater.

New Yorkers have long been embroiled in an epic struggle with the oil and gas industry, fighting for basic necessities and resources that are often repeatedly compromised by the drilling and fracking process such as clean water, air, and food, not to mention good health and a sustainable future. New Yorkers know that not only do we need to protect our pristine public lands by banning fracking in those areas, but we also need to protect all Americans from this dubious practice which involves the injecting of millions of gallons of water laced with toxic, cancer causing chemicals in order to shatter bedrock.

Studies show that the process of drilling, fracking, processing and transporting natural gas results in a tremendous amount of methane being released into the air. Methane is 70-100 times more potent than CO2 over a 20- year time frame. Recently published peer-reviewed studies on methane emissions show that, at present, gas extraction and combustion significantly contributes more greenhouse emissions than burning coal.

So not only is fracking dangerous, but the methane emissions from fracking accelerate climate change and spell disaster for our country.

The best way to protect our revered public lands and the rest of our country – including our air, water, food, health and climate - from fracking is to prohibit this inherently dangerous form of fossil fuel extraction entirely. This comment is submitted under protest the question isn't how we should be fracking, but if we should be doing it at all.

President Obama and the Bureau of Land Management: We will not stand idly by while private companies are allowed to pump our public lands full of chemicals that harm our health. We demand a complete ban on fracking for oil and gas on all public lands!

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is considering new regulations that would expand private companies' ability to drill and frack for oil and gas on public lands from coast to coast. We have until August 23rd, when the comment period ends, to join together and demand a ban on fracking on our public lands.

Fracking on public lands jeopardizes drinking water across the country — from Washington to West Virginia, from Montana to Florida. Each time a new well is fracked, tens of thousands of gallons of toxic chemicals, including known human carcinogens and endocrine disruptors, are pumped deep underground to force oil or natural gas to the surface.

There’s no un-contaminating our water supply. Now’s the time for us to act – together.

Here is just one comment, from Mary Russell of Carbondale, Colorado:

I am calling for an immediate ban on oil and gas fracking on all federal lands. The Bureau of Land Management's draft rules for fracking on public lands fail to protect the water we drink, the air we breathe, the climate we depend on, and the land many of us call home. This land is our land and should be managed for the good of the people, not corporate profits for the oil and gas industry. 

I recently sold my house in Glenwood Springs because it sits on the edge of the lower Roaring Fork River, threatened by possible hydraulic fracturing in the Thompson Divide. My property value has plummeted since the doubling of oil and gas development around my home in the past ten years. I've been diagnosed with asthma since moving into my home five years ago.

Since moving to Colorado in 1991, I've seen the public lands I used to swim, bike, hike, and backcountry ski closed to me. No longer can I hike in areas off of Mamm Creek or bike outside of Paonia due to gates erected to keep me out of the public lands my taxes support. I don't swim in the North Fork of the Gunnison for fear of water contamination from hydraulic fracturing in areas whose creeks feed this river. I used to lead my students through the back roads and trails of Grand Mesa, on skis, bikes, and on foot. The views were spectacular as we hiked the Crag Crest Trail or rode our bikes out to Lands End. Now, the fracking trucks along I-70 and the lights of hydraulic fracturing towers obscure our view.

As a DJ on my community public radio station, KDNK, in Carbondale, Colorado, I played Woodie Guthrie's song, ""This Land is Your Land"" on the 4th of July this year. I dedicated the song to all my listeners, and to all the politicians who have lost sight of what democracy means.

President Obama is about to issue his first major policy on fracking. The Bureau of Land Management has issued draft rules for fracking on 600 million acres of public and Indian lands, like those near me in Colorado. Unfortunately, these rules are straight out of the oil and gas industry's playbook. The provisions on disclosure of the toxic chemicals used in fracking were written by ExxonMobil and taken straight from model bills peddled by ALEC, the right-wing American Legislative Exchange Council. And the draft rules do nothing to protect watersheds that provide drinking water to millions of people.

We have until August 23 to submit our comments to the Bureau of Land Management, and on August 22, anti-fracking leaders will hand-deliver our comments to the BLM in Washington, D.C. ","Oil and Gas; Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands"

Action to address climate change is desperately needed, but any real plan to combat climate change cannot include fracking for natural gas and oil as part of the solution. Drilling, fracking, and transporting gas and oil releases large amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the air and contributes to climate change. We are asking you to stop promoting natural gas as a bridge fuel and to take action to ban fracking on all public lands. Natural gas is not clean - we need real renewable energy solutions now.

On June 25, President Obama delivered a major speech on climate change. While there was much to be applauded in the speech, a centerpiece of his plan relies on increased drilling and fracking for natural gas and oil. In fact, the President repeatedly lauded ""cleaner"" natural gas.

Studies show that the process of drilling, fracking, processing and transporting natural gas results in a tremendous amount of methane being released into the air. Methane is 70-100 times more potent than CO2 over a 20- year time frame. Some recently published studies on methane emissions show that burning natural gas may be even worse, in terms of the overall greenhouse gas footprint, than burning coal for electricity and burning fuel oil to heat homes or run industrial boilers. We need to get off of all fossil fuels now.

This summer, the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management is accepting comments on a weak set of rules to regulate fracking on federal public lands. We need to tell them to ban fracking on public lands.

Fracking and drilling pollute our water, our air, and our communities but it also drives climate change. Tell President Obama that natural gas is a false solution and that we need to invest in real renewable energy solutions now. ","Oil and Gas; Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands"

Comments: Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands

We are deeply concerned that Bureau of Land Management’s new draft fracking rule is even weaker than the previous version. The regulations seem designed to encourage as much fracking as possible, while doing little to protect the environment or public health.

There are many egregious flaws in the BLM’s revised draft fracking regulations:

They expand “trade secrets” loopholes and allow well operators to avoid disclosing use of dangerous fracking chemicals;

They only require oil and gas companies to report the chemicals used that are not claimed to be trade secrets — and only after fracking has already taken place;

They provide little regulatory protection for air, water and climate. The regulations do nothing to protect people living near fracked wells from air pollutants that increase risks of cancer and respiratory illness;

They do not protect residents from exposure or contamination by the large volume of toxic wastewater fracking produces;
    
There is no requirement to collect and disclose baseline data on air and water quality needed for effective regulation; and
The rules even ignore the advice of the Obama administration's advisory board.

The best way to protect our revered public lands and our air, water, health and climate from fracking is to prohibit this inherently dangerous form of fossil fuel extraction. Please ban fracking on public land.","Oil and Gas; Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands"

These comments have been collected by CREDO Action. Though the comments vary slightly from person to person, the majority read as follows: 

“The Bureau of Land Management's draft fracking regulations are a disgrace. It's clear that the BLM caved to pressure from the fracking industry instead of standing up for Americans' right to drink clean water, breathe clean air, and live on a planet with a stable climate. Fracking is an inherently toxic practice that no amount of regulation can make safe. Moreover, with the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere passing 400 parts per million--well beyond what many scientists say is safe--any policy that allows fracking on federal lands to continue is dangerous and unacceptable. We demand an immediate ban on all shale oil and gas fracking on federal lands.”

Petition Background

One of the things that makes America great is our vast and cherished spaces. Millions of acres across our beautiful country are public, but this land, and many of our favorite iconic landscapes, are under threat from fracking.

The Obama Administration recently proposed new rules for oil and gas fracking on federal lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) — including those in the national forest system, and federal lands that are nearby many treasured national parks.

Fracking, defined as the combined process of drilling, fracturing, processing, disposing of waste and transporting oil and gas, has not been proven safe, yet fracking operation continue to be approved putting our public health and environment at risk.

The agency's mission is ""to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of America's public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations."" Fracking clearly conflicts with this mission. Sign the petition to ban fracking on public lands.

To fulfill that responsibility, new fracking regulations must provide full disclosure of chemicals prior to any drilling as well as adequate safety measures to prevent contamination of both ground and surface waters.  I support Bureau of Land Management's decision to improve the underground cement casings to prevent the release of fracking fluids and urge the Bureau of Land Management to require closed-looped containment of fluids above ground to eliminate open waste pits.""
 
Thank you for this opportunity to submit public comments on the BLM's Proposed Federal Hydraulic Fracturing Rule. Please contact me with any comments or questions.

Submitted as public comments on: 80 FR 45154, ""Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Revision of the Section 4(d) Rule for the African Elephant (Loxodonta africana),"" Proposed Rule, 29 July 2015 
(Document ID FWS-HQ-IA-2013-0091)

On behalf of 1,013,942 concerned WWF Supporters 

I commend the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Obama administration for such a firm commitment to end the devastating slaughter of elephants for their ivory and to ensure that the United States is not helping to drive the illegal wildlife trade.

Along with 80% of the American people, I strongly support ending commercial trade in elephant ivory in the US. I believe we must take all necessary steps to protect these magnificent creatures from extinction.

Fewer than half a million elephants remain in Africa's savannas and jungles--a 95% plunge over the last 50 years. Recently, the killing has surged: Poachers are slaughtering on average one elephant every 15 minutes, and some populations are now on a path to extinction.

Reports from US intelligence agencies and the UN also show that profits from ivory trafficking are fueling crime, corruption and violence in fragile African democracies and financing organizations that threaten both American and African security.

America's role in the consumption and sale of ivory makes us complicit in this crisis and weakens our moral authority to lead internationally. The US is the world's second-largest market for wildlife products, and significant amounts of illegal elephant ivory have been found entering the American market. We must strengthen our laws to prevent this from happening and to encourage other countries to act with similar urgency.

I thank you and others in the administration, including the president himself, for your unprecedented leadership on this issue. Combined with new US efforts to combat wildlife trafficking, the ivory rules proposed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service can help turn the tide for Africa's elephants.

I share the American public's desire to halt the US role in the illegal ivory trade, and I believe that the decision to halt elephant ivory commerce in the US is the right response to the current crisis.

For the sake of the world's elephants, I urge you to keep that promise.","Revision of the Special Rule for the African Elephant"

Re: Comments on the African Elephant Special Rule Amendment; Docket No. FWS-HQ-IA-2013-0091

Dear Chief Hoover,

Please find attached, 38,395 comments submitted by NRDC online activists regarding the Obama Administrations Proposed Rule revising the Section 4(d) Rule for the African Elephant (Loxodonta africana) contained at 80 Fed. Reg. 45154 (July 29, 2015). 

We deeply appreciate the Services commitment to elephant conservation and urge the Service to move quickly to strengthen and finalize these new protections. With 30,000 elephants being killed every year for their ivory tusks, the Administration must act swiftly to close the final loopholes in federal laws that have allowed ivory trafficking to flourish. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at (202) 717-8193. 

Thank you. 

Sincerely,

The CFPB must not let debt trap payday lenders continue business as usual. The proposal doesnt go far enough to ensure that someone can repay the loan and have enough money to live on. Also, the proposal requires only that the payday lender not have default rates worse than other payday lenders. These business as usual loopholes allow payday lenders to say that their ability to seize money from a borrowers bank account is the same as the borrowers ability to afford the loan.

""People should have enough money to live on after making a payment on loan. This means being able to afford both the loan payment and the light bill, not one or the other. Additionally, everyone should be able to make payments without reborrowing or defaulting on other expenses. 

""The proposed rule doesn't go far enough: it leaves too much room for lenders to game the system and continue to make unaffordable loans. The rule must provide more objective measures for how lenders document expenses so that every loan can be affordably repaid.""","Payday, Vehicle, Title and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans"

Dear Ms. Jackson,

Attached please find 45,342 individual public comments collected online by CREDO Action for submission to the comment period on the proposed payday lending regulations. Individual comments may differ throughout, although the majority read as follows: 

""The proposed payday lending rule is a major step forward but should be strengthened to better protect American consumers from predatory lenders. The CFPB should apply ability-to-repay requirements to every loan, limit total indebtedness, increase protections against loan flipping, and broaden the rule to cover any loan that enables lenders to coerce repayment from borrowers.""

The proposed rule gives a ""free pass"" to payday lenders to make six bad loans, allowing lenders to sink people into a dangerous debt trap before the rule kicks in. The CFPB was right to base their proposal on the standard that borrowers should be able to repay their loan, but that standard must be on every loan, from the first loan. The CFPB should also enact protections to prevent lenders from stringing people along by ensuring a 60 day break between loans and limiting 'short term' loans to 90 total days of indebtedness per year.","Payday, Vehicle, Title and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans"

"1672",1178621,723,"NA","Karen Darnall","Mass Mail Campaign 188: Comment Submitted by Karen Darnall (Total as of 9/26/2016: 723)","I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (""CFPB"") proposed rule entitled ""Payday, Vehicle Title, and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans"", which is Docket No. CFPB-2016-0025.  The proposal takes important steps to curb payday lending and other predatory and abusive lending practices.  That effort should be commended.  

However, I am writing to express my concerns with the anticipated impact this proposal will have on the customers of Louisiana banks and other federally insured depository institutions.

In remarks at a field hearing on the proposed rule in Kansas City, MO on June 2, CFPB Director Richard Cordray was quoted as saying:  ""In particular, we are not intending to disrupt existing lending by community banks and credit unions that have found efficient and effective ways to make small-dollar loans to consumers that do not lead to debt traps or high rates of failure.  Indeed, we want to encourage other lenders to follow their model.""

My concern is that the current proposal, if unchanged, will do exactly what Director Cordray said the rule is not intended to do:  that is, disrupt small-dollar lending by these federally insured depository institutions.
  
The requirements of this proposed rule are overly complex and prescriptive, and inconsistent with how depository institutions with a relationship with their customer underwrite small-dollar loans.  If finalized in its current form, the additional compliance costs and regulatory risk posed by this proposal could reduce or eliminate many small-dollar loan products offered by depository institutions.  That result would significantly harm consumers by reducing much needed small-dollar credit options.   

Unlike payday lenders and vehicle title lenders, federally insured depository institutions are already heavily regulated at both the state and federal level, and routinely examined for compliance with state and federal lending and consumer protection laws.  I am not aware of deficiencies in the current regulatory framework for federally insured depository institutions that would warrant additional regulation in the small-dollar loan area, nor am I aware of any compelling arguments that the small-dollar loans being offered by such depository institutions are bad options for consumers.  Therefore, subjecting federally insured depository institutions to the additional regulation contained in this proposal is not necessary or appropriate. 

Finally, my understanding is that Section 1022 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 gave CFPB certain authority to exempt from its regulatory requirements any class of covered persons, service providers, or consumer financial products or services.  Director Cordray recently commented on the CFPB's exemption authority in a letter dated August 17 that he sent to 70 U.S. Senators.  In his letter, Director Cordray also gave examples of CFPB's previous use of that authority to tailor its regulations.  His letter was in response to a letter sent by the U.S. Senators on July 18 requesting ""that the CFPB carefully tailor its regulations to match the unique nature of community banks and credit unions.""  

Based on my above comments, I respectfully urge the CFPB to exercise its exemption authority in order to exempt all federally insured depository institutions from the provisions of this proposed rule.

Thanks for your consideration of my comments.","Payday, Vehicle, Title and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans"

"1701",1178621,520,"Helping Hands Ministry of Belton, Inc.","Rucker Preston","Comments Submitted by Rucker Preston, Helping Hands Ministry of Belton, Inc.","Director Cordray,

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the CFPB's proposed rule that was announced in June. I am the Executive Director of Helping Hands Ministry of Belton, a non-profit, human service organization that serves low-income families with relief, development, and advocacy opportunities. In the first comment letter that is attached, I speak on behalf of Helping Hands Ministry of Belton, Inc. I will share with you why the board of directors and this organization as a whole feels that it is important for the CFPB to enact and enforce strong rules that protect the most financially vulnerable people in our country. 

Additionally, you will find documents with comments from 520 other people our community who feel that the CFPB needs to put forward a strong federal law to protect the most financially vulnerable people in our country.

In particular, please pay attention to the section in the comment letter by Helping Hands Ministry about Henry Montelongo and his comment in a separate comment. He tells his story about how he felt pressured to sign a letter from a short-term lender, stating that any regulations enforced upon the payday & auto title loan industry by the CFPB would be absurd. He says in his comment that this is opposite to his feelings and experience, however, he was scared not to sign the letter. He believed that this vehicle would have been repossessed if he did not sign the letter, which states that the CFPB should not regulate this type of practice.

In these comments, you will hear about how our organization became deeply affected by the short-term, high-cost loan industry, borrower testimonies, and recommendations for the proposed rule. 

As someone who has been deeply invested in payday lending reform for the past two years, I want to thank you for thoughtfully crafting a rule to protect consumers against the predatory practices of payday and auto title businesses. But I'd like to encourage you to add a few extra measures to make the rule even stronger.

In short, my recommendations are:

1.	Ensure that every loan has a realistic ability-to-repay standard applied to it.

2.	Look more closely at long-term loans, and ensure that the terms of these loans are affordable.

3.	Strengthen protections against loan flipping.
   a.	Loans should have a minimum 60 day cooling off period.
   b.	Stronger protections against repeat refinancing of longer-term loans are necessary.

4.	Ensure that the proposed rule apply to both Credit Service Organizations (CSOs) and Credit Access Businesses (CABs).

5.	Ensure that definitions in the rule are clear, and that they encompass state laws as well as local ordinances.
   a.	Specifically, these terms ought to be defined: rollover, refinance, renewal, payment, installment

Director Cordray, thank you again for the extremely hard work you and your staff have done in crafting this rule. Thank you for the opportunity to comment in favor of the proposed rule. I will celebrate the day when effective protections ensure that more vulnerable consumers are protected from unjust lending practices, and I am confident in your ability to bring about that change. I am grateful for your work.

With gratefulness,

Rucker L. Preston

I urge you to finalize the Army Corps of Engineers and Environmental Protection Agency's proposed Clean Water Act, Waters of the U.S. rule, as soon as possible, follow the science that shows how water bodies are interconnected, and fully protect all of the waterways that have important connections to one another.

Basic clean water protections for headwater streams and wetlands have been in question for too long. I strongly support protecting the nation's streams, ponds, wetlands, and other waters from pollution. The proposed rule is an important step toward achieving this goal. Preserving our sources of clean drinking water is of the utmost importance. Finalizing a strong rule will secure Clean Water Act protections for countless streams and wetlands, which help supply the drinking water of more than 117 million Americans.

The rule as proposed is a major improvement. I urge you to further strengthen the final rule to fully protect wetlands and other waters found outside the floodplain of covered waterways. Science shows that the health of these waters influences stream flow, water quality, and wildlife in waters downstream.

I urge you to continue to stand up to special interests that oppose these importantand popularclean water protections.

EPA has already received more than 100,000 letters in support of moving forward with this rule to protect streams, wetlands, rivers, and other waters from pollution or destruction. Hunting and angling organizations, public health professionals, and hundreds more local elected officials, farmers, citizens, brewers, and other business leaders have spoken out in support of enhanced protections.As one of the many supporters of this critical initiative to protect our waters from pollution, I thank you and urge you to finalize a strong Waters of the U.S. rule that includes full protection for the nation's waters as soon as possible.

Re: Revised Definition of Waters of the United States under the Clean Water Act (CWA)
 	
Dear Administrator McCarthy,
 
We, the 106 undersigned organizations, who use and depend on our rivers systems from the headwaters, wetlands and tributaries to floodplains and bays, call on you to put the Clean Water Act (CWA) back to work on all U.S. waters.  We join our diverse voices with the farmers, ranchers, and other rural leaders quoted herein and undersigned, in a joint call to EPA to restore clarity by approving a final Waters of the USA rule. 

We support the rule for the reasons Mr. Alfonzo Abeyta, a fifth generation Colorado ranch-er, highlights in a new video on why restoring CWA  protection is important for agriculture and rural communities:   Farmers know that everything is connected. Snow from the moun-tains feeds the streams. The streams feed the rivers. The rivers feed us. You cant grow food without water without water nothing survives it is our job to protect it.  (http://www.rmfu.org/colorado-farmer-r-e-m-featured-in-waters-of-the-u-s-video/)

We support the Clean Water Act because it has worked in every state improving water quality, stemming the loss of wetlands and safeguarding streams, lakes and wetlands.  That is, it worked until two Supreme Court decisionsSolid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County (SWANCC) v. Army Corps of Engineers (2001) and Rapanos v. United States (2006)created uncertainty regarding what waters are protected, and curtailed CWAs scope. 

Water is the lifeblood for agriculture, small businesses and recreation.  We dont want to go back to the day when two-thirds of our waterways were too polluted for fishing, swimming or drinking.  Therefore those of us in rural communities, agriculture and other small busi-ness need the full protection of the Clean Water Act restored to the countless miles of tribu-tary and seasonal streams, wetlands and rivers that sustain our communities.  
Communities need a strong CWA to address severe and continuing threats like chemicals from mining operations that leaked arsenic into the Alamosa River in Colorado, killing all the fish and compromising the water supply; the arsenic, boron, chromium, and manganese from coal ash, dumped for years into the Dan River by Duke Energy, exceeding the facility's ""compliance boundary and polluting rural water supplies; as well as the tides of phospho-rus washed from fertilized farms, cattle feedlots and leaky septic systems upstream that contributed to an algae bloom in Lake Erie which compromised water sources for the cities. We are concerned about the growing contamination in many areas that leaves waterways still too polluted to sustain agriculture, recreation and many other uses.

As producers and others who depend on clean water, we know well that how water is cared for upstream affects river systems downstream. Small streams feed our local sources of drinking water and support traditional irrigation systems and agriculture for tribal, acequia, historic land grant and our diverse farming communities.  Wetlands protect our communities from flooding, and support fish, wildlife, livestock and recreation. The entire river system provides drinking water sources in rural areas and cities alike, and is vital to small businesses  as well. 

We support the rule because we recognize our shared responsibility to protect our entire river systems including the streams and wetlands that nourish the riversfor fishing, boating, recreation, flood control, local water systems and to meet the needs of our com-munities, our farmers, ranches and fishers, our businesses, and protect these bioregions for future generations.  
Many of the undersigned groups have submitted their own comments supporting the com-pletion of the rulemaking process while proposing specific and beneficial improvements.  We believe EPA should take these views into account in issuing the final rule.  

As farmers and small businesses that share the water, we need a regulatory scheme that is clear, predictable, timely, and focused on protecting aquatic resources.  We support the rules exemptions for commonplace farm and ranch operations and incentives for volun-tary conservation practices. We also urge EPA and NRCS to review and retain all of the ex-emptions and exclusions from the Clean Water Act for the farming and agriculture commu-nity including exempting them from the need to obtain a 404 permit when using any of 56 conservation practices  practices that are good for farmers, ranchers, and for clean water.

Dear Administrator McCarthy:

Thank you for proposing the Clean Water Rule that will restore and clarify the Waters of the United States safeguarded by the Clean Water Act. I support the proposed rules protections for headwater streams and wetlands, and urge you to take additional steps in the final rule to restore protections for prairie potholes and other important waters. 

These protections are vital for the survival of many fish and wildlife species that depend on wetlands and pure, clean streams for their habitat. They are also essential to protecting the drinking water for 117 million Americans.

Thank you again for taking this important first step to protect Americas waters.

On proposed rule redefining the Waters of the United States pursuant to the Clean Water Act:

""Ditch the rule!""

Statement To President Barack Obama, EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers:

The proposed rule represents an expansion of federal regulatory authority beyond the language and intent adopted by Congress in the Clean Water Act.

The Supreme Court twice rejected attempts by regulators to assert authority over isolated waters ruling that waters must have a a continuous surface connection"" or significant nexus to navigable waters. 

Congress repeatedly voted not to adopt policies similar to those in the proposed rule. If the rule is adopted it usurps congressional authority. 

The proposed rule would bring vast amounts of land under federal control adding unnecessary and redundant red tape to areas currently adequately regulated by state and local governments.

EPA's cost-benefit analysis is deeply flawed, employing decades old cost estimates that were not adjusted for inflation, or current economic and market conditions.

We, the undersigned, declare that the proposed rule will place undue regulatory burdens and limitations on people attempting to responsibly use their land, adds new regulatory dead weight to the economy and would produce no meaningful gains for the environment or the nation and should not be promulgated.

Re: Docket ID: EPA-HQ-OW-2011-0880

I am deeply concerned about protecting our drinking water. I support the Waters of the U.S. rulemaking currently underway by the US EPA and the Corps of Engineers. I believe this rulemaking will clear up confusion surrounding the implementation of clean water programs.

The longstanding confusion has allowed many previously protected waters from having adequate protection, leaving drinking water supplies for one-third of Americans at risk.

The proposed rule addresses the massive growth of expansive factory farms while keeping in place the exemptions for normal farming and ranching activities, such as plowing, seeding, harvesting, construction of stock ponds and irrigation ditches.

Thank you for considering my comments in support of the Waters of the U.S. rulemaking. I urge the US EPA and the Corps of Engineer to move forward as quickly as possible to finalize these rules clarifying the protections offered under the Clean Water Act.

Please find attached the names of 50,456 veterans, military family members, and VoteVets supporters advocating for a strong Renewable Fuel Standard.

Here is the comment they have added their names to: 

Please preserve a strong Renewable Fuel Standard and increase America's 2017 biofuel targets to the statutory levels called for by Congress. Weaker targets for domestic biofuels threaten the economic, environmental and energy security benefits of America's most successful energy policy.
 
As veterans, military families and VoteVets supporters, we know the cost of America's dependence on foreign oil. We cannot afford to become complacent about shielding our country against the next spike in oil prices or crisis in the Middle East.
 
By protecting America's domestic energy producers from manipulation by foreign cartels, this simple policy has started a revolution that drives billions of dollars of economic activity across the U.S. and supports more than 852,000 American jobs.
 
More than that, investing in cleaner-burning, American-made energy saves consumers money at the pump and reduces emissions.
 
Don't allow special interests to set America down the wrong path. Strengthen the Renewable Fuel Standard, and keep our country on the road to true energy security. .
 
Thank you,","Renewable Fuel Standard Program: Standards for 2017 and Biomass-Based Diesel Volume for 2018"

Biofuels provide a clean, renewable alternative to oil, allowing us to decarbonize transportation fuels, reducing the need for more drilling and fracking that pollutes our water, air and pristine habitats. 

On average, corn ethanol reduces CO2 emissions by 34 percent and advanced biofuels can reduce emissions by 100 percent or more over gasoline.  Globally, ethanol has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 110 million metric tons - the equivalent of taking more than 20 million vehicles off the road.

Biofuels displace cancer-causing gasoline additives like benzene, the same chemicals found in cigarette smoke. These dangerous additives have also been linked to asthma and drinking water contamination.

I believe that a fully realized RFS that a bipartisan congress passed will put money back in the pockets of hard-working Americans. As result of the RFS, ethanol is now blended in 97 percent of our gas supply and has helped to reduce gasoline prices by as much as $.50 to $1.50 a gallon.
 
The RFS drives billions of dollars of economic activity across the U.S., starting with farmers and rural communities. The ethanol industry supports nearly 400,000 jobs and contributes nearly $52 billion to our Gross Domestic Product. The bottom line is that the RFS creates jobs, empowers struggling rural communities and is saving consumers at the pump.

There are 524 unique comments. 21,843 comments request the following:

""To protect vulnerable populations of monarchs and other wildlife that depend on native grasslands, I ask that your agency acknowledge the severe environmental impacts of corn ethanol production and adjust your final Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandate downward.

Native grasslands are disappearing at an alarming rate, along with the monarch butterfly and other wildlife species that depend on them. Studies show the RFS increases demand for corn, contributing to the conversion of millions of acres. Please defend, don't destroy habitat for monarchs and many other species. Reduce the mandate for corn ethanol, don't increase it. 

Additionally, I ask that EPA implement the land conversion protections contained in the law. The RFS includes protections against converting untilled lands for biofuel production. Yet EPA has not implemented this provision as Congress intended. Given the threats to remaining grasslands and the steep declines of monarchs and other wildlife, the land-clearing provision must be enforced to fully protects these critically important habitats.

These two actions together would put us on a better path to meeting our goals for cleaner fuel that does not make it harder to bring monarchs back from the brink. Thank you.""

Every year, power plants release more than 386,000 tons of toxic air pollutants into the air we breathe. These emissions -- which aren't subject to any federal limits to protect our health and safety -- impose a heavy burden on Americans in the form of cancer, heart and lung disease, and thousands of premature deaths every year. The technology to reduce these costly emissions is available and affordable, and I strongly support the EPA's Power Plant Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which will make our air safer to breathe by requiring that power plants use these proven methods of pollution control to limit their harmful emissions.

In the coming months, I urge you to resist any efforts to weaken or delay your recent proposal to limit power plants' emissions of mercury, lead, arsenic, dioxin, acid gases and other toxic pollutants. The power plant industry has already used its financial and political influence to avoid these important health protections for more than two decades. We cannot wait any longer.

Power plants pump more mercury into our air than all other big industrial polluters combined. Mercury pollution damages aquatic ecosystems and contaminates fish species that many Americans rely on for recreation and nourishment. Pregnant women and young children are most at risk: mercury exposure can lead to birth defects and learning disabilities and can also irreparably impact a young child's ability to talk, think, read, write and learn. It is critically important that we protect these vulnerable members of our society from harm. 

The Power Plant Mercury and Air Toxics Standards will prevent up to 17,000 premature deaths every year and spare many more Americans the physical and financial costs associated with illnesses brought on by breathing dirty air. These benefits to our society should be non-negotiable, considering especially that they outweigh the costs to polluters by as much as 13-to-1.","National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Coal- and Oil-fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units"

ATTN: Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0234

""Dear Administrator Jackson, 

Thank you for proposing long-overdue Clean Air Act standards to protect our nation’s communities from the threats of toxic air pollution produced by power plants. Power plants are the largest source of toxic air emissions in the United States, and yet no national standards exist to protect communities from the toxic air pollution from these sources.

Power plants emit some of the most hazardous pollutants known to us. In addition to mercury and arsenic, power plants emit lead, other heavy metals, dioxin and acid gases. Even in small amounts these extremely harmful air pollutants are linked to health problems such as cancer, heart disease, brain damage, birth defects, asthma attacks and even premature death.

Without strong protections, thousands of people will continue to suffer. The EPA needs to adopt the strongest air toxics protections possible and stand its ground against industry pressure to weaken the proposed standards. Please continue to defend public health and protect our communities and children from mercury and other toxic air pollution.""

Thank you for the opportunity to share these comments with you today.

"1965",670876,4595,NA,NA,"Mass Comment Campaign sponsored by Clean Water Action (Web)","RE: Docket ID Number EPA-HQ-OW-2017-0203: Comments on Definition of Waters of the United StatesRecodification of Preexisting Rule, Federal Register, Vol. 83, No. 134 (July 12, 2018)

Dear Acting Administrator Wheeler and Assistant Secretary James,

Please find attached 4,595 comments from Clean Water Action members opposed to the reckless plan to repeal the 2015 Clean Water Rule. These are in addition to thousands of other postcards and letters from Clean Water Action members that have been submitted separately. These letters not only urge the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers to drop the scheme to wipe out these common sense protections for our water, they also urge the agencies to abandon the scheme to permanently weaken safeguards with a new rulemaking. 

The Administrations latest attempt to justify its proposal to repeal the Clean Water Rule lacks merit. Last year the agencies received 685,000 comments on its original notice of proposed rulemaking to repeal the Clean Water Rule (dated July 27, 2017) and nearly half a million of those comments were in strong opposition to this plan. The new legal theories offered by the Administration in this supplemental notice are weak at best and ignore the overwhelming scientific evidence that protecting small streams and wetlands is essential to ensuring water quality in downstream rivers and larger water bodies. The 2015 Clean Water Rule creates more certainty, not less, regarding which water resources are federally protected, and is legally and scientifically sound.

These thousands of members represent many thousands more opposed to this dangerous plan for our water. Thank you for considering their views.

Sincerely,
Lynn Thorp 
National Campaigns Director

Dear Administrator Pruitt and Mr. Lamont:

Attached are comments from approximately 9,000 Clean Water Action members and supporters from across the country that all oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers' (Corps) proposal to repeal the 2015 Clean Water Rule. An additional 30,000 comments have been submitted on paper.

The Clean Water Rule is needed to better protect critical water resources from harm, including small streams that feed drinking water sources and wetlands that filter pollutants and buffer communities from flooding. Repealing this commonsense, thoroughly vetted rule will needlessly put the communities that depend on these water resources at increased risk of exposure to pollution. 

The job of the EPA and the Corps is to protect people from pollution and to safeguard communities from harm. The agencies should listen to the majority of Americans who want a strong Clean Water Act and immediately withdraw this reckless proposal. Should the agencies propose to revise the 2015 Clean Water Rule, they must engage in a robust stakeholder process and any proposed replacement rule must not further roll back protections for small streams and wetlands.

Comment:

For 45 years, the Clean Water Act has protected our natural resources, and helped keep drinking water safe. In 2015, the Clean Water Rule finally extended protections to streams and wetlands that flow into our larger bodies of water -- helping to ensure that over 117 million Americans have access to clean drinking water. The existing rule incorporates input from 400 stakeholder meetings, one million public comments, and synthesis of more than 1200 peer-reviewed scientific publications, and should not be rescinded. It allows more pollution in our nation's waters, and threatens our public health and the economy.

I oppose the roll-back of the Clean Water Rule.

RE: Docket ID Number: EPA-HQ-OW-2017-0203: Comments on the Repeal and Replacement of the 2015 Definition of Waters of the U.S.

Dear Environmental Protection Agency:

I am writing in response to your recent request for comments on the repeal of the Clean Water Rule. As someone who supports protections for this nation's waters, I strongly oppose this attack. 

Before finalizing the Clean Water Rule in 2015, EPA held more than 400 meetings with stakeholders across the country, received over 1 million comments--more than 80 percent of which were in support of the rule--and published a synthesis of more than 1,200 peer-reviewed scientific publications, which showed that the small streams and wetlands the rule safeguards are vital to larger, downstream waters.

Repealing the Clean Water Rule would put many of our waters at risk, including waters that are critical for drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and wildlife. It would also affect our economy. Consumers spend $887 billion annually in outdoor recreation and the outdoor recreation economy is responsible for 7.6 million American jobs. Without protections for wetlands and small streams, the outdoor industry will likely suffer. The costs of treating our water also go up when streams and wetlands aren't protected.

Clean water is fundamental to our health and economy, something our nation recognized a long time ago in passing the Clean Water Act. I urge you to reconsider this proposal and leave the Clean Water Rule in place.

We, the 100 undersigned elected officials, business owners, farmers and non-profit leaders listed in the attached document, write in strong opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers' (Corps) proposal to repeal the 2015 Clean Water Rule, and any subsequent effort to weaken federal protections for our waterways.  These rollbacks would recklessly open waterways upon which we all rely to degradation and pollution.
 
We are parents and grandparents, doctors and nurses, business owners, anglers and outfitters, and farmers and ranchers. We are communities at risk from contaminated water and flooding. We are local officials charged with protecting the public's health, safety, and welfare.  Some of us even consider ourselves environmentalists. We all depend upon clean water - whether for drinking, our health, fishing, swimming, paddling, wildlife, or even our jobs.
 
Finalized in 2015, the Clean Water Rule restored federal protections to half the nation's streams, which help provide drinking water to 1 in 3 Americans.  The rule also protects millions of acres of wetlands that provide wildlife habitat and keep pollutants out of 49,000 miles of waterways in Pennsylvania.  No wonder more than 800,000 Americans - including more than 1,000 business owners, local officials, farmers, and health professionals - urged EPA to adopt the the Clean Water Rule.  
 
Repealing the Clean Water Rule turns the mission of the EPA on its head: the agency charged with safeguarding our drinking water is proposing to stop protecting drinking water sources for 8 million Pennsylvanians. It defies common sense, sound science and the will of the American people.
 
Clean water is vital to our ecology, our health, and our quality of life.  We are already seeing drinking water contaminated by algal blooms and toxic chemicals, and a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico that scientists now estimate will be the size of New Jersey this summer. We should address these threats by strengthening the Clean Water Act and its applicability, not weakening them.
 
We call on EPA and the Corps to reconsider this reckless repeal and stand up for our drinking water.

I oppose recent efforts to weaken national fuel efficiency standards for cars. 

If kept intact, these standards would cut carbon pollution nationwide by 6 billion metric tons, protecting the environment and public health. In addition, Pennsylvania has saved $1.2 billion since automakers, federal and state governments and other stakeholders agreed upon the rules on October 15, 2012.

You should be strengthening clean car standards, not putting the nation in reverse.

As a young American, I am writing to you today strongly opposed to proposed rollbacks to America's Clean Car Standards. 

Rolling back the clean car standards will make our air more polluted and will force drivers into dirtier, less-efficient vehicles that are more expensive to drive. Tearing down successful and achievable climate change and air pollution protections endangers everyone, and slashing money-saving standards just as gas prices hit a four-year high amounts to a direct attack on families who can't afford to pay more at the pump.

Please stand up for our families and communities who are in danger today and the young people who will inherit the consequences of this reckless action for the rest of their lives.

Please find 52,825 comments attached for inclusion in the docket, EPA-HQ-OAR-2018-0283-0756, The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Rule for Model Years 2021-2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks. 10,146 individuals took the time to write the EPA a personal message, and all 52,825 have signed the following text:

Dear Acting Administrator Wheeler,

The clean car standards (the CAFE and greenhouse gas emissions standards) are one of the most important ways we have to reduce climate pollution right now. Flatlining or reducing the improvements from these rules will cost people money and make climate change worse. 

When originally set, these rules would save people thousands of dollars a year and keep billions of barrels of oil in the ground. Barely two years ago, the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency did a robust analysis of the impact of these rules. They found the costs have actually dropped over the first few years of implementation. There is no evidence that these standards need to be changed in any way. 

Additionally, Californias authority to set their own emissions standards should be protected, as should the ability for other states to follow Californias standards. Congress explicitly gave California and these states the authority to set these strong environmental protections. These rights should be protected, and this provision should be dropped from any final rule. 

By rolling back these standards, you will be taking money from hard working people and putting it in the pockets of big oil and the car companies. Keep these standards as is and protect our environment and pocketbooks.

We respectfully request that the 52,825 comments submitted by the individuals listed in the document below as well as in the attached spreadsheet be reflected in the final comment tally for this docket.

The clean car standards are a successful policy that deliver the safe, clean, fuel-efficient cars that our families want and need. They are helping us protect our children's health and future by fighting climate change. Rolling back these standards forces parents into dirtier, less-efficient cars, and is a direct attack on the health of our children.

As a person of faith, I am writing to show my support for the current, strong, and forward-looking clean car standards. I object to any attempt to undermine the standards after they were finalized in a public process with comments from millions of Americans. 
Those bearing the burden of pollution are most often lower-income households and communities of color. It is our moral obligation to protect the most vulnerable among us, the neighbors that our religious traditions call us to care for. Weakening the standards would harm these families and communities first and worst.

Transportation is the largest and fastest growing source of carbon pollution and oil consumption in the U.S. Our vehicles account for almost 50% of oil used in the United States and nearly one third of our climate pollution. The current standards are the most effective policy that we have to address global warming, and we cannot afford to retreat from climate solutions as our communities are being harmed by its impacts here and now.


We are called to be stewards of Creation. Turning our backs on a policy that protects our air and our climate is wrong. Turning the nations back on a policy that protects the most vulnerable is a terrible injustice.

RE: Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards

Dear Secretary Chao and Acting Administrator Wheeler:

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and EPA just issued a joint Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and the Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Emissions standards for model years 2022-2025 that proposes to significantly weaken the existing standards. The current policy was adopted in 2010, after an agreement between the federal government, labor, auto manufacturers and states. The existing strong standards are good for American innovation and business and good for consumers, which is why the business leaders signed below from across the country strongly oppose this NPRM.

Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2) is a national, nonpartisan group of business leaders who advocate for smart policies that are good for our economy and good for our environment. Our members have founded or funded more than 2,500 companies, created more than 600,000 jobs, and manage more than $100 billion in venture and private equity capital.

An ambitious set of vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards benefits consumers and businesses alike and as a nation we prosper when we prioritize innovation and competition while ensuring a stable business policy environment. All of this requires leadership from our elected officials and decision makers at federal agencies, such as EPA and DOT, in partnership with the state officials. 
 
Strong long-term standards have been critical and remain essential to continued recovery of the automotive sector since the economic crash a decade ago. They are key to ongoing innovation and job growth, and to a further strengthening of our manufacturing sector. Since the modern standards went into effect in 2012, we have seen record vehicle sales of vehicles and fuel economy coupled with growing employment in the auto industry. These standardswhen maintainedprovide certainty for the investment that drives innovation.

That innovation makes domestic automakers and their vast network of suppliers competitive in a global market that continues to demand cleaner vehicles. This investment also supports domestic jobs. According to the 2017 edition of the report Supplying Ingenuity, there are 288,000 direct manufacturing and engineering workers in 1,200 facilities across 43 states who are building the technologies that make vehicles cleaner and more fuel efficient.
 
Similarly, the 2018 U.S. Energy Employment Report which E2 recently published along with partners at the National Association of State Energy Officers (NASEO) and the Energy Futures Initiative, found that at least 650,000 jobs in the motor vehicles sector are focused on increasing fuel economy or transitioning to alternative fuels through their daily activities or supply chains.
 
In 1985 more than two-thirds of Detroit Three unit sales were in North America. By 2025, it is projected that only one-third will be sold in North America, while two-thirds of sales will be overseas. In those global markets, consumers demand, and governments often mandate, more fuel efficient and cleaner vehicles compared to the North American market. They also ensure American cars can compete in nations which have far higher gasoline prices than we do in the United States. If we rollback these standards we will cede market share to international competitors already quickly moving to capitalize on our lack of leadership.
 
Lastly, standards protect American families, businesses and institutions against gasoline price volatility. The CAFE standards in 2025 will save drivers between $3,200 and $5,700 over the life of a new car. In fact, improved fuel efficiency is forecast to save Americans a total of about $50 billion by 2030. Instead of going to foreign oil cartels, that is money that can be reinvested in local communities across the country.   
 
E2s members recognize the economic opportunity and necessity of increased fuel economy. We strongly urge both EPA and DOT to do the same, and not rollback these badly needed and highly beneficial standards.
 
Sincerely,  
503 E2 Members

Dear Acting Administrator Wheeler, 

I write today on behalf of Environment Americas members and supporters across the country who want clean air and a healthy climate. We strongly oppose the administrations attempts to weaken the nations fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission standards.
 
Limiting global warming pollution from transportation--the single largest source of such pollution in the US--is a critical step forward to protect our children from the worst impacts of climate change.  The clean car standards are the single greatest action the US has taken to date to address global warming. We must continue to make progress and cut pollution while curtailing our oil consumption.
 
The clean car standards are the nations most effective program at fighting global warming. Data about pollution and climate-related deaths should be taken into account. Air pollution from transportation is responsible for a staggering 30,000 premature deaths each year, and the changing climate is endangering communities across the country, from more extreme wildfires to more intense storms.
 
By boosting fuel economy, American families save money. Drivers of new vehicles introduced in 2018 will save an average of $2,605 in fuel costs. 
 
These standards are working, and they are saving families money at the pump, while reducing carbon pollution and making the air cleaner and safer for us all to breathe. 
 
There is a reason - many reasons - that 87% of Americans agree automakers should continue to improve fuel efficiency and that hundreds of thousands of comments have already been submitted in support of the current standards. Over the past year, Environment America has defended these standards with over a thousand health professionals, 550 small businesses, and tens of thousands of people joining us in calling for cleaner cars. Environment America previously submitted over 45,000 grassroots comments in support of strong vehicle standards and is submitting an additional 20,852 today. We ask that these names be entered into the official record and considered as separate public comments
 
The existing standards are set to reduce climate pollution by as much as 6 billion metric tons over the lifetimes of the vehicles--the equivalent to carbon pollution from 150 coal-fired power plants for an entire year. 
 
Our families, our health, and our environment are counting on these standards.
 
We strongly urge you not to weaken the clean car standards. Doing so would threaten our health, our environment, and cost American families money.

Morgan Folger

""The African lion population has decreased nearly 50% and they have disappeared from 75% of their historic range, meeting the criteria to be listed as ""endangered"" under the Endangered Species Act.

""In just a few decades, the African lion population fell from more than 75,000 to fewer than 40,000. Despite the decline in number, African lions are still being hunted as trophies.

""The U.S. is the world's largest importer of lions and lion parts for commercial and recreational trade - this includes skulls, claws, hides, live lions, and recently, even as food served in restaurants.

""Some people have tried to argue that big game trophy hunters inject money into the local economies, which is then used for conservation. Humane Society International has flatly rejected that notion, saying that none of the money from canned lion hunts is used for wildlife conservation.

""Protect African lions under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. There clearly is no legitimate reason to kill African lions, and their continued slaughter for ""sport"" is causing their rapid disappearance from the wild.

Dear Secretary Salazar and Director Ashe,
I am writing to urge that the Department of Interior's USFWS list the African lion as ""Endangered Throughout its Range"" under the Endangered Species Act.

Lions have disappeared from over 80% of their historic range, and their population declined by nearly 50% from just 1980 to 2002. The threats facing African lions today are numerous and reinforcing: habitat destruction and fragmentation, loss of traditional prey species, disease, and inevitable conflict with humans.

The United States can help to stop this marked decline by addressing unsustainable trophy hunting and commercial trade in lion parts.The United States is by far the world’s largest importer of both commercially traded African lion parts and lion trophies. This trend is only increasing.

Protecting African lions under the U.S. Endangered Species Act would begin to curtail this trade and allow lions to recover.

We are writing, both as editors of InternationalMosaic.com and individually, to provide additional  comments on and objections to the proposal to limit the use of scientific evidence in rulemaking proceedings. Indeed, as was pointed out in, inter alia, our letter dated May 24,  2018, the proposal suffers from multiple fatal flaws that require the proposal's withdrawal.

For example, in the April 23, 2018 letter submitted by 985 scientists and technical experts, the scientists and technical experts say:

""As scientists and technical experts, we urge you to cease any plans to restrict the types of science that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can use in regulatory decisionmaking. EPA can only adequately protect our air and water and keep us safe from harmful chemicals if it takes full advantage of the wealth of scientific research that is available to the agency.""

By itself, the attached letter constitutes legally sufficient evidence to compel the conclusion that the proposed rule must be rejected as bad for the environment. In  addition, the letter provides more than sufficient  evidence that adoption of the proposed rule without careful and public consideration of the letter constitutes arbitrary and capricious action violating the Administrative Procedure Act. Finally, the letter adds to the abundant  evidence that the National Environmental Policy Act requires the  preparation of a proper Environmental Impact  Statement before the  regulation can be adopted.

Attached, please find the signatures of 11,302 Moms Clean Air force supporters from across the country who have submitted comments regarding the EPA's Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science proposal. Please consider each a formal comment in the federal docket regarding Docket Number EPA-HQ-OA-2018-0259. 

The comment they each submitted reads: 

As a parent, I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule, Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science. 

This misleading rule requires that EPA consider only those scientific studies that use publicly available raw data. This would prevent EPA from using studies that are based on personal medical data, thereby eliminating some of the most important long-term epidemiological studies investigating the impacts of pollution on public health. This proposal would significantly limit the research and data that EPA can use to make informed policy decisions under major public health and environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and Toxic Substances Control Act. 

American families depend on the EPA and high-quality science to protect us from the impacts of air pollution and toxic chemicals. This proposal puts that protection in jeopardy, placing the health of our children at risk.

"2169",469598,118,NA,NA,"Mass comment campaign sponsored by Cornell Alliance for Science (Web)","I submit this comment as a concerned citizen to call on the EPA to exclude valid science from regulations on air pollution and other health issues.

The EPA already relies on transparent science to make its decisions. The proposal will not improve this process. Instead, it would allow the agency to ignore critical studies that show the relationship between our health and the environment. We cannot limit the information used to protect our health and environment.

The effects of air pollution and other environmental risks are documented by research that has already undergone a long-established, transparent peer review process. Many of these studies contain confidential patient information that cant and shouldnt be made public. This is no reason to exclude those studies critically important, well-vetted findings. I am deeply concerned that EPAs proposal would allow the agency to ignore these important health studies.

Our communities depend on the EPA to use the best available scientific evidence in making policy decisions. We deserve clean air and water and ask that you adhere to the EPA mandate to protect our health and environment. The EPA must rely on the best available science to protect our future - this proposal makes that impossible.

Please withdraw this proposal and send a message that your time as head of the EPA will bring back science-based policies to protect our planet.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the proposed delisting of grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem from the Endangered Species List. I am extremely concerned about your agency's proposed rule and ask that you take the following steps before finalizing it:

* Afford National Park Service managers a formal role in the management of bears on habitat adjacent to park borders, and fully address their concerns. In particular, ensure there are measures in place to protect bears that roam beyond national park boundaries. Hunting inside National Park Service legislative boundaries, on park-adjacent lands, and in key habitat connectivity corridors should be strictly prohibited in the proposed plan and the individual state management plans.

* Include policies and firm commitments to promote Yellowstone bears naturally connecting to populations in Glacier National Park and other areas.

* Clearly articulate how climate change will impact grizzly bears' habitat, food sources and behavior, and how your proposal takes these changes into account.

* Provide the public with a clear and detailed plan for how grizzlies will be managed and protected, and for how their long term conservation will be assured, once management is turned over to state wildlife agencies.

Your proposal to remove endangered species protections from Yellowstone and Grand Teton grizzly bears fails to address these critical concerns and must therefore be revised to ensure the long term health and protection of these amazing animals. 

Thanks again for considering my comments.

RE: Docket # EPA-HQ-OPP-2014-0195

Dear Administrator McCarthy, 

We are writing to urge your agency to reject Dow's application for the ""new use"" of 2,4-D with its Enlist line of genetically engineered seeds. This antiquated, dangerous herbicide is prone to drift off target, damaging neighboring crops and threatening the health of nearby communities. 

As you know, 2,4-D is a reproductive toxicant, suspected endocrine disruptor and possible carcinogen. Children are particularly susceptible to its effects. If EPA approves Dow’s new 2,4-D formula, use — and therefore exposures — will go up. Agricultural scientists warn that widespread planting of Enlist corn could trigger as much as a 25-fold increase in use of 2,4-D on corn, from an estimated 4.2 million lbs. at present to over 100 million lbs. by 2019.

Recognizing a potential public health disaster looming on the horizon, 70 physicians, nurses and other health professionals have already urged EPA to reject Dow’s application for new uses of 2,4-D on genetically engineered corn.    

American farmers, too, are deeply concerned that Dow’s Enlist corn system will threaten their crops and therefore their livelihoods. Drift from 2,4-D is already responsible for more episodes of crop injury than any other herbicide, and its vastly increased use promises still more damage to crops like non-GE soybeans and cotton, vegetables and fruit.  

While Dow says it has developed a new formulation less prone to drifting for miles, the older highly volatile formula is still widely available and its lower cost creates a powerful market incentive to continue its use. And we know from experience that regardless of best practices put forth, pesticide drift is difficult to contain.

We urge you to reject Dow's application and keep 2,4-D from being widely used across America's farmland. 

Sincerely, 

Judy Hatcher, Executive Director, Pesticide Action Network

"2207",448129,17691,NA,NA,"Mass comment campaign submitted by David Murphy, Founder/Executive Director, Food Democracy Now (17,691 comments)","ATTN: Dow Chemical’s “Enlist Duo” 2,4-D and Glyphosate Herbicide Mix, Docket No. EPA-HQ-OPP-2014-0195-0427 
Dear Administrator McCarthy,

On behalf of the non-profit sustainable agriculture organization Food Democracy Now!, I would like to submit the following comments to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on behalf of more than 17,691 American farmers and citizens to urge that this administration reject the approval of the Enlist Duo 2,4-D and glyphosate herbicide combination developed for application to Dow Chemical’s genetically engineered herbicide-tolerant corn and soybeans.
I am writing to urge you to deny approval for Dow Chemical’s Enlist Duo 2,4-D and glyphosate herbicide combination, a major component of Agent Orange, the chemical defoliant used by the U.S. military in Vietnam, and glyphosate, the main chemical component in Monsanto’s best selling herbicide Roundup for the Environmental Protection Agency’s Docket No. EPA-HQ-OPP-2014-0195-0427. 

The scientific community has sounded alarms about the dangers of 2,4-D for decades. Numerous studies link 2,4-D exposure to major health problems such as cancer, lowered sperm counts, liver toxicity, Parkinson’s disease and birth anomalies in the children of pesticide applicators. Industry and independent scientific tests show that 2,4-D is still contaminated with dioxins. Dioxin contaminants in Agent Orange are thought to be a major cause of many serious medical conditions in both Vietnam veterans and the Vietnamese, including birth defects in the children of exposed parents. EPA has reported that 2,4-D is the seventh largest source of dioxins in the U.S. 

Commercial approval of Dow’s soy will trigger a large increase in 2,4-D use, but USDA has not conducted a meaningful review of the consequent harm to native ecosystems, crop injury from 2,4-D drifting onto neighboring fields, or the evolution of weeds resistant to 2,4-D. 2,4-D is already the number one culprit in drift-related crop injury complaints, and the huge increase in its use with 2,4-D soy will exacerbate these harms. Even the existing uses of 2,4-D have been found likely to jeopardize protected species such as Pacific salmon, and likely to adversely affect the California red-legged frog and Alameda whipsnake; USDA’s approval of 2,4-D soy would worsen these impacts, as well as place many other similar and endangered species at risk. 

Additionally, Dow plans to sell this GE 2-4,D soy “stacked” with resistance to glyphosate—the active ingredient in Roundup—, yet neither Dow nor USDA has analyzed the potential synergistic or cumulative impacts that these planned combinations pose. 

Dow is hyping 2,4-D corn and soy as the supposed solution to glyphosate-resistant weeds, which themselves were fostered by GMO Roundup Ready crop systems. As Dow and other pesticide firms develop new crops resistant to ever more herbicides, weeds will match and exceed them by evolving multiple resistances, and farmers will respond with increasingly toxic herbicidal cocktails. This chemical arms race with weeds means more pesticidal pollution, more disease, higher production costs, and of course increasing profits for firms like Dow that sell both GE seed and pesticides. 

In addition, an increasing number of studies have shown that Roundup is possibly linked to serious human health problems including birth defects, infertility, allergies, liver disease and auto-immune problems.

Already, the over application of Roundup has led to the explosion of superweeds on more than 70 million acres of U.S. farmland, leading to economic hardship for America's farmers and the loss of critical habitat and an alarming decline in Monarch butterfly populations. Rather than double down on this deeply flawed and unsustainable technology, America must invest in more productive methods of food production, like organic and sustainable agriculture.

At a time when farmers, citizens and government have worked hard to limit our use of, and exposure to, toxic chemicals like 2,4-D and dioxins, approving the Enlist Duo herbicidal mix for new GMO crops will take us dramatically backwards, endangering human health and the environment. I urge you to heed the warnings of the scientific and environmental communities and deny approval of Dow Chemical’s Enlist Duo herbicidal mix created for 2,4-D and glyphosate resistant genetically engineered corn and soy. At the very least, the EPA must conduct a comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement that carefully examines the human health, environmental and agricultural harms that will be triggered by the increased application of the combination of 2,4-D and glyphosate, including a cumulative assessment that considers the compounded harms from additional deregulation of Dow’s 2,4-D and glyphosate herbicidal mix.

The dramatic rise in glyphosate use in conjunction with Roundup Ready crops tells 
us that widespread use of 2,4-D on corn and soy that is genetically engineered to 
tolerate the herbicide will create a surge in its application. The use of 2,4-D has 
already gone up several-fold since bottoming out in the early 2000s. Experts predict 
its use could increase by 50 times if the use of Enlist Duo on Dow’s herbicide 
tolerant crops is approved. 

Dramatically increasing the use of these herbicides would exacerbate the public 
health crisis that is growing in the U.S. and other countries where 2,4-D and 
glyphosate are widely used. 

Please consider this new evidence that 2,4-D and glyphosate are too dangerous to 
continue to be used in food production:

We urge EPA to reject Dow’s petition for use of its Enlist Duo on herbicide-tolerant 
corn and soy, and we call on your Agency to instead ban these dangerous 
herbicide.

Enclosed are 69,558 individual public comments collected by CREDO Action for submission to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone docket. Individual comments may differ throughout, although the majority read as follows: 

The Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to protect public health by setting standards that reflect scientific and medical knowledge. Set the standard to 60 parts per billion in order to adequately protect public health and safety. Anything less will endanger health and does not comply with the law.

The comments have been split into 15 documents in order to facilitate uploading to the Regulations.gov website.

Dear EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, 

Please find attached the 1st of 13 documents containing 51,396 public comment submissions all recommending the EPA move ahead with the proposed federal regulations for coal ash storage and handling. While the statements vary, the majority of them read as follows: 

"" I strongly support EPA moving ahead with proposed federal regulations for coal ash storage and handling. 

Improperly disposed of coal ash threatens our communities and our wildlife. So as you weigh your options for regulating coal ash, I hope you will consider the harm toxic contaminants in coal ash present to our drinking water and our streams.

Every year, 130 million tons of coal ash--containing arsenic, chromium, lead and mercury--is created by coal-fired power plants.  The toxins contained in the coal ash seep into our ecosystems and into our drinking water from unsafe storage in waste ponds and other venues.

States with most of the coal ash also have the weakest regulations--that's why it is critical that we set federally enforceable standards for coal ash disposal.  

Please do not cave to the coal industry by simply putting forth suggested guidelines for states. Safeguard our environment, protect public health and ensure that Dirty Coal properly handles this toxic waste.""

Dear EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, 

Please find attached the 8th of 13 documents containing 51,396 public comment submissions all recommending the EPA move ahead with the proposed federal regulations for coal ash storage and handling. While the statements vary, the majority of them read as follows: 

"" I strongly support EPA moving ahead with proposed federal regulations for coal ash storage and handling. 

Improperly disposed of coal ash threatens our communities and our wildlife. So as you weigh your options for regulating coal ash, I hope you will consider the harm toxic contaminants in coal ash present to our drinking water and our streams.

Every year, 130 million tons of coal ash--containing arsenic, chromium, lead and mercury--is created by coal-fired power plants.  The toxins contained in the coal ash seep into our ecosystems and into our drinking water from unsafe storage in waste ponds and other venues.

States with most of the coal ash also have the weakest regulations--that's why it is critical that we set federally enforceable standards for coal ash disposal.  

Please do not cave to the coal industry by simply putting forth suggested guidelines for states. Safeguard our environment, protect public health and ensure that Dirty Coal properly handles this toxic waste.""

To: EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy

We are pleased that your agency has proposed revisions to the Worker Protection Standard, which provides workplace protections to farmworkers. These improvements are long overdue and vital to the health of farmworkers. They include (1) more frequent and improved safety training; (2) stronger requirements for protective equipment; and (3) wider buffer zones between application sites and working crews.

Some very important improvements are missing. We urge you to strengthen the proposed rule to ensure that the new WPS

    Adequately protects young farmworkers: The draft rule allows children as young as 16 to handle hazardous pesticides. This is not adequately protective, as teens bodies are still developing and are more vulnerable to toxic pesticides than adults. No child under the age of 18 should be allowed to handle pesticides.
    Protects farmworkers right to know: Farmworkers must have easy access to vital information about pesticides used in their workplace so they can take precautions to avoid injury. Workers shouldnt have to ask their employers for the name of the pesticide and its health effects, where and when it was applied, and when its safe to reenter a sprayed field. The central posting requirement for all pesticide applications should be reinstated.
    Provides safeguards for pesticide applicators: Workers who handle neurotoxic pesticides deserve the strongest protections medically available. California and Washington state have long-standing programs that monitor applicators exposures to these dangerous pesticides and have helped to reduce illness due to overexposure. All workers who handle these neurotoxins should have the same protections, regardless of the state in which they work.
    Our food system depends on the labor of more than 2 million farmworkers across the country. We hope and expect that you will act to ensure that these workers are provided the safe and healthy workplace they deserve. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Dear Environmental Protection Agency,

I care about the health and safety of our country's 2 million farmworkers and their families who work tirelessly to put food on our table.  While I commend the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for proposing a stronger Worker Protection Standard (WPS) to safeguard farmworkers from harmful exposures to pesticides, I write to support many aspects of the proposed rule that foster worker health and safety and to underscore areas of the rule in need of strengthening in order to better protect farmworkers. 

Farmworkers are the population most overexposed to pesticides, and for far too long farmworkers have been treated as second class, afforded fewer protections than other workers. At a minimum, farmworkers should to be given the same protections afforded to workers in most other industries. 

Preventing occupational injury and exposure is fundamental to worker protection and it is imperative that we take the strongest regulatory approach to preclude farmworker exposure to pesticides and adequately address cases of overexposure. To that end, I recommend the following: 

* Training Frequency: Workers in other industries receive annual safety training and farmworkers deserve the same protection. To better protect farmworkers and their families from pesticide exposure, I support annual pesticide safety training for workers and pesticide handlers.

* Medical Monitoring: Medical monitoring is common in other industries and pesticide handlers deserve the same protections that are afforded to other workers. I support requiring medical monitoring for farmworkers who mix, load or apply handle the two particularly dangerous classes of neurotoxic pesticides (organophosphate and N-methyl carbamate pesticides) before symptoms or illness occurs. I strongly disagree with EPA's decision not to implement such a program nation-wide. Employers should give workers the option of blood tests to monitor exposure to these neurotoxic chemicals before symptoms or illness occurs. Since California and Washington have implemented a system to monitor workers who handle these types of pesticides, the number of poisonings involving these pesticides has gone down considerably in those states. 

* Hazard Communication: Reinstate the requirement for pesticide hazard information to be posted in a central location where farmworkers will know where to find it, rather than putting the burden on the farmworker to ask the employer for the information as currently proposed. Due to language barriers, legal status and/or fear of retaliation, workers will be reluctant to ask their employer for the information. Such information should also be available in nonemergency situations.

* Emergency Assistance: We support the EPA proposal to require employers to make transportation to a medical facility available to workers and handlers within 30 minutes of learning of an exposure and to require the employer to provide to the worker, handler or the treating medical personnel the Safety Data Sheet and pesticide label (as opposed to waiting for it to be requested). 

* Respirator Training and Fitting: We support requiring employers of pesticide handlers to comply with existing OSHA standards on respirator use, fit-testing of respirators, and medical evaluation requirements whenever a respirator is required by the labeling. 

* Mandatory Posting of Fields: Requiring posting of signs (rather than verbal notice) notifying workers about not reentering fields where pesticides that require a 24-hour period before reentry have been applied (rather than limiting the signage requirement to the two-day or 48-hour waiting period in the proposal). Monterey County, CA requires posting of fields where pesticides that require a 24-hour wait is applied and found that this approach resulted in a significant reduction in pesticide-related illness due to early reentry, which is a major cause of farmworker pesticide exposure and illness ...

Dear Environmental Protection Agency,

Exposure to pesticides is one of the daily realities in the lives of the 2.5 million farmworkers in the U.S. today. Given their persistent exposure to harmful pesticides, it is not surprising that thousands experience acute pesticide illness or injury each year, and countless others suffer chronic health problems as a result of these toxic exposures. 

As a member of Earthjustice, I commend the EPA for moving forward in proposing stronger pesticide safety regulations to protect farmworkers and requiring record-keeping to facilitate enforcement. I respectfully submit the following comment on the proposed changes. Improving the protections, training and information available to workers will reduce human illness and protect wildlife and the environment. Improving farmworker health and safety will protect these vulnerable workers from needless suffering and injury and have far-reaching benefits by reducing healthcare costs and strains on our public health care system.

Farmworkers are the population most overexposed to pesticides, and for far too long farmworkers have been treated as second class, afforded fewer protections than other workers. At a minimum, farmworkers should be given the same protections afforded to workers in most other industries.

Training and related record-keeping should be improved. I applaud the Agency's efforts to improve the frequency and quality of pesticide safety trainings, as well as to institute record-keeping of when these trainings take place. I strongly support annual safety trainings. These are much needed changes.

Training on preventing take-home exposures is particularly important. Pesticide residues on a worker's hair, skin and clothing directly impact the health and well-being of young children in the home. Children are more vulnerable to the impacts of pesticide exposure, particularly during critical windows of development.

I appreciate that the Agency has proposed to reduce the 'grace period' before full WPS training is required, but this revision does not go far enough. EPA has proposed shortening the grace period to 2 days. No 'grace period' of any duration should be permitted. An uninformed farmworker is not equipped to do her or his job without putting themselves, their fellow workers, or their families at undue risk. The risks posed by allowing untrained workers to handle toxic chemicals, even for two days, is not tolerated in any other industry that involves exposure to hazardous chemicals. Workers must be adequately trained before they begin work.  

The current requirement for central posting should not be eliminated but should be enhanced. Farmworkers need ready access to basic information about the pesticides being used at their worksites. Posting information about recent pesticide applications in a central location is one of the most effective ways for workers to protect themselves from pesticide exposures. While there are limitations to this method, it should not be eliminated. Many farmworkers work in greenhouses, nurseries, and ferneries, where a central posting location is common and is viewed by the workers. The expectation that workers can obtain this information from their employers ""upon request"" is unreasonable and unrealistic. Farmworkers should not be expected to question their bosses in order to obtain information about pesticide applications that may endanger their health. Rather than eliminate this protection, EPA should retain the central posting requirement and in addition require training that provides specific information on the names and effects of the pesticides to which the workers will likely be exposed ...

They requested we share the following message:

We are pleased that your agency has proposed revisions to the Worker Protection Standard, which provides workplace protections to farmworkers. These improvements are long overdue and vital to the health of farmworkers. They include (1) more frequent and improved safety training; (2) stronger requirements for protective equipment; and (3) wider buffer zones between application sites and working crews.

Some very important improvements are missing. We urge you to strengthen the proposed rule to ensure that the new WPS

Adequately protects young farmworkers: The draft rule allows children as young as 16 to handle hazardous pesticides. This is not adequately protective, as teens bodies are still developing and are more vulnerable to toxic pesticides than adults. No child under the age of 18 should be allowed to handle pesticides. 

Protects farmworkers right to know: Farmworkers must have easy access to vital information about pesticides used in their workplace so they can take precautions to avoid injury. Workers shouldnt have to ask their employers for the name of the pesticide and its health effects, where and when it was applied, and when its safe to reenter a sprayed field. The central posting requirement for all pesticide applications should be reinstated. 

Provides safeguards for pesticide applicators: Workers who handle neurotoxic pesticides deserve the strongest protections medically available. California and Washington state have long-standing programs that monitor applicators exposures to these dangerous pesticides and have helped to reduce illness due to overexposure. All workers who handle these neurotoxins should have the same protections, regardless of the state in which they work. 

Our food system depends on the labor of more than 2 million farmworkers across the country. We hope and expect that you will act to ensure that these workers are provided the safe and healthy workplace they deserve. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Enclosed are 67,038 individual public comments collected by CREDO Action for submission to the Agricultural Worker Protection Standard Revisions docket. Individual comments may differ throughout, although the majority read as follows: 

More than 1 billion pounds of dangerous pesticides are used in the production of agricultural crops in the U.S. annually, poisoning up to 20,000 farmworkers each year.

More protection for workers means greater access to protective equipment, more frequent safety trainings, mandatory entry restrictions on pesticide-treated fields until they are safe, and a first-ever 16-year-old minimum worker age restriction.

I urge you to enact the EPA's revised Worker Protection Standard to protect agricultural workers from toxic chemical exposure.

The comments have been split into 15 documents in order to facilitate uploading to the Regulations.gov website.

Re: Docket: EPA-HQ-OAR-2014-0827-2368

Please find 10,747 comments attached for inclusion in the docket, EPA-HQ-OAR-2014-0827-2368, ""Repeal of Emission Requirements for Glider Vehicles, Glider Engines, and Glider Kits."" 1,022   individuals took the time to write the EPA a personal message, and all 10,747 have signed the following text:

""Dear EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, 
The EPA should not repeal the emission requirements for glider vehicles, glider engines, and glider kits. 

Rolling back standards that limiting pollution from glider kit trucks (freight trucks with a used engine installed in an otherwise new frame), is a waste of taxpayer dollars and endangers the health and safety of American families and our climate. If the glider truck loophole were left open until 2025, EPA estimates indicate that glider vehicles would comprise only 5% of the freight trucks on the road but would account for 33% of all nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions from the heavy truck fleet, resulting in as many as 12,800 premature deaths. 

Used engines in gliders can emit as much as 40 times the greenhouse gas and particulate pollution of modern engines. But a repeal would declassify ""glider kits"" as new vehicles or engines, making them no longer subject to air pollution control requirements. A rollback is a blatant attempt to rig the system for the glider industry at the expense of American families and jobs. Nothing has changed in the last year that warrants a reopening of this lifesaving rule. 

A rollback of the glider kit emission standards would endanger public health and safety, the EPA should keep the rule intact.""

We respectfully request that the 10,747 comments submitted by the individuals listed in the two documents below be reflected in the final comment tally for this docket.

"2388",367455,1775,NA,NA,"Mass Comment Campaign sponsored by Moms Clean Air Force (web)","Attached are the comments of 1,775 Moms Clean Air Force supporters across the country who have expressed concern about the EPA's proposal to repeal the emission standards and other requirements for heavy-duty glider vehicles, glider engines, and glider kits. The comment they each submitted reads: 

As a mom, I oppose EPA's efforts to reopen the glider trucks loophole. Super-polluting diesel engines should not be exempt from clean air rules. 
 
I am extremely concerned about the public health impacts of glider truck pollution. The pollution from diesel engines has been linked to heart attacks, arrhythmia, stroke, premature death, asthma, respiratory infections, lung cancer, low birth weight, and infant mortality.

Old engines in glider trucks can emit as much as 40 times the air pollution of modern engines. If the glider truck loophole were left open until 2025, EPA estimates indicate that glider vehicles would comprise only 5% of the freight trucks on the road but would account for 33% of all nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions from the heavy truck fleet. The resulting cardiovascular and respiratory disease would lead to thousands of premature deaths. 
 
The proposed rollback endangers the public's health and represents a profound disregard for EPA's core mission of protecting public health from pollution. EPA should put our health first. Protect our families from dangerous diesel pollution, and keep super-polluting glider trucks off the road.

Attached are the signatures of 50,221 Environmental Defense Fund supporters from across the country who have submitted comments opposing EPA's proposal to repeal emission requirements for glider vehicles, glider engines, and glider kits. The comment they each submitted reads: 

""I'm writing today with great concern over EPA's proposal to reopen the 'glider truck' loophole. Doing so would give an unfair competitive advantage to these super-polluting trucks over trucks that achieve clean air standards. 

Freight truck leaders invested in and now sell cleaner freight trucks and engines. Reopening this loophole could put their prudent investments--and their employees' jobs--at risk, which is why numerous trucking industry leaders have publicly opposed the unfair competition and pollution that would be allowed by a glider kit loophole. 

But this policy wouldn't just unfairly pick winners and losers in the industry. It would put Americans' lives at risk. According to EPA estimates, if the glider truck loophole were left open until 2021, glider vehicles would result in as many as 6,400 premature deaths. These trucks emit as much as 40 times the pollution of modern engines, contributing to a host of respiratory problems that increase our national healthcare costs and put our lives at risk. 

Reopening this loophole takes America in the wrong direction. Please reconsider this dangerous decision.""

"2426",334545,22122,NA,NA,"Mass Comment Campaign sponsoring organization unknown (22,122)","Dear Mr. President:

I support the proposed rule to increase fuel economy for new passenger
vehicles to an average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, which will
allow cars and light trucks to drive farther on a gallon of gas and
reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil.

The price of gas is once again squeezing the budgets of American
families, who already are forced to cut back in other areas just to pay
for basic transportation needs.

This spring, you set a goal of reducing oil imports by one-third this
decade, and in November you proposed fuel efficiency standards that
will effectively double current requirements. I commend your efforts. I
believe it is important to increase U.S. investment in fuel efficient
technologies, save consumers money at the pump, help this country break
its dependence on foreign oil, and protect the environment. Don't let
these standards be watered down -- protect and finalize the new fuel
efficiency rules.

Sincerely,

Jim Georges","EPA/NHTSA Joint Rulemaking to Establish Light-duty Vehicle GHG Emissions Standards and CAFE Standards for Model Year 2017 and Later"
"2427",334545,13300,NA,NA,"Mass Comment Campaign sponsored by National Wildlife Federation Action Fund (13,300)","I am submitting the following comments in support of strong fuel efficiency standards, along with the names of the 13,300 supporters of the National Wildlife Federation Action Fund who have sent similar comments to the docket via emails to a-and-r-Docket@epa.gov:

I support making our nation's cars and trucks more efficient to cut the carbon pollution from car exhaust that is driving global warming, which threatens the future of American wildlife.

Taken together, the new and proposed fuel economy standards will cut our demand for oil by 3.4 million barrels per day.  That equates to nearly a third of today's transportation fuel use and it cuts carbon pollution by more than 600 million metric tons per year in 2030--that's about 10% of total US carbon pollution today.

These deep oil savings also mean less pressure for risky new drilling projects in the Arctic or to clear cut forest for Canadian tar sands. 

Please move forward with strong fuel efficiency standards that cut oil use and reduce carbon pollution.

Thanks you!","EPA/NHTSA Joint Rulemaking to Establish Light-duty Vehicle GHG Emissions Standards and CAFE Standards for Model Year 2017 and Later"

Petition Text

Letter to Bureau of Land Management Thank You for Combating Natural Gas Waste

I'm writing to voice my support for the recent draft rule to limit the waste of natural gas on our public lands. At present, this waste on our federal and tribal lands here in the West undermines energy security and threatens our health - and means taxpayers are losing out on millions of dollars in revenue each year that we could use to improve our schools, build new roads, and repair infrastructure.

Thanks to leadership from the Bureau of Land Management, we now have a draft rule that will take steps to combat this waste, on behalf of all American taxpayers, by reducing flaring, reducing venting, and modernizing the royalty rates charged on wasted gas. Now, I'm writing to ensure that this rule stays strong.

A strong rule to cut natural gas waste on America's public lands would phase out flaring from oil and gas operations, require companies to use a affordable, commonsense technologies that are available now, and require regular (at least quarterly) monitoring to detect leaks.

Thank you for your leadership on this issue. I support a strong rule aimed at ending natural gas waste.","Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation"

"2520",324602,3253,"TakePart",NA,"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-01865","To:Bureau of Land Management Principal Deputy Director Neil Kornze
Thank you for taking action to lower methane waste and pollution from the oil and gas industry on our public lands. To protect our climate from harmful methane pollution, we need to stop venting and flaring, and the Bureau of Land Management's draft rules are an important step forward.
As the administration finalizes these rules, I urge you to make some improvements to ensure that public lands are protected and gas is not wasted:
	Improve leak detection and repair requirements by increasing the frequency of required leak inspections to quarterly for all wells
	Strengthen the control measures and monitoring requirements applicable to pneumatic controllers by requiring the use of zero-bleed pneumatics where feasible and extending standards to intermittent-bleed as well as continuous-bleed natural gas-driven pneumatic controllers
	Improve flaring regulation to more effectively limit the waste of federal and tribal natural gas resources from flaring by making gas-capture plans mandatory and binding, tightening exemption provisions by limiting the scope of current exemptions, their length, and the ability to renew exemptions indefinitely, and requiring operators to report all capture and forgone revenue information in applications; also set a time limit beyond which flaring, even below 1,800 MCF per month per well, is prohibited
	Ensure enforcement of venting, flaring, and leak regulations; enforcement of waste minimization plans is also crucial to ensuring that the plans are carried through during development and production of oil and gas on federal lands
	Improve the rule to provide for improved transparency and accountability by allowing for more public involvement and comment
In addition to strong standards to curb methane pollution and waste, we must work to keep as many fossil fuels in the ground as possible if we are going to stave off the worst effects of climate change. Methane is a highly potent greenhouse gas that we cannot continue to emit if we want to meet the administration's international climate commitments. It's time to end oil and gas leasing on public lands.

Petition: 

Subject: Please finalize strong standards for methane pollution

Dear BLM Director Kornze,

Thank you for proposing commonsense safeguards to reduce natural gas waste and methane pollution from oil and gas drilling on America's public and tribal lands. Reducing methane pollution that is vented, flared, and leaked from our public lands is a win for our climate, public health, and taxpayers. These proposed regulations are an important step in the right direction and I urge you to finalize them as quickly as possible. 

As the administration finalizes this rule, I ask that you eliminate several loopholes and strengthen the rule to ensure a fair return to taxpayers and adequate protection for public health and the environment. Please ensure that strong enforcement measures are included, while also strengthening limits on flaring and increasing the frequency of required leak detection and repair inspections. 

Thank you again for taking this critical step to protect our climate and environment.  I urge you to strengthen and finalize the proposed regulations as soon as possible to ensure we leave a safe and healthy planet for generations to come. 

Sincerely, 
The undersigned

Reducing waste and protecting the climate (RE: BLM-2016-0001-0001)

Dear Secretary Jewell and Director Kornze,

Thank you for proposing commonsense regulations that will reduce natural gas waste and pollution on America's public and tribal lands. Reducing natural gas waste is a win for taxpayers, the climate and public health. While the proposed regulations are an important step in the right direction and I urge you to finalize them as quickly as possible, I also ask that you eliminate several loopholes and strengthen the rule to ensure a fair return to taxpayers and adequate protection for public health and the environment.

By requiring oil and gas companies to capture natural gas that would otherwise leak into the air or be vented or burned in a flare, the proposed regulations capture both finite energy resources and millions of tax dollars for federal, state and tribal governments that can be used to fund schools, healthcare and needed road improvements. The BLM is required by law to ensure that these publicly owned resources are not wasted. 

I applaud the BLM for regulating existing oil and gas infrastructure, which is responsible for substantial emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane. Regulation of existing sources is necessary to achieve our international climate commitments and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The BLM's proposal will also protect public health by reducing emissions of ozone-forming pollutants linked to asthma attacks, heart disease and premature death.

The BLM should improve the proposed regulation to better address methane waste and pollution on federal and tribal lands. For example, the BLM should tighten the flaring requirements, increase the frequency with which operators must check for and repair leaky equipment, eliminate loopholes, ensure proper enforcement, and increase transparency through public involvement. 

I am pleased to see the BLM taking steps to modernize its approach to waste on public and tribal lands. A 2016 Colorado College poll found that 80 percent of Westerners support commonsense measures to cut down on waste. The public hearings held across the West confirmed widespread and diverse support for waste reduction measures. Please strengthen and finalize the proposed regulations as soon as possible.

RE: Postponement of Certain Compliance Dates for the Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELG) and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category

The Environmental Law & Policy Center (ELPC) submits 166 comments opposing the postponement of certain compliance dates. 

In 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revised outdated toxic water pollution discharge standards for power plants. Once implemented, this Toxic Water Rule would eliminate 1.4 billion pounds of toxic metals and chemicals like mercury and lead, and other harmful pollutants from being dumped into our rivers, lakes and streams every year.  ELPC and our members strongly oppose EPA's proposal to delay certain compliance deadlines for the ELG (or Toxic Water Rule), which was published in the Federal Register on November 3, 2015 and became effective on January 4, 2016.
In the five years leading up to the 2015 Toxic Water Rule, many coal plants dumped thousands of pounds of toxic metals and other harmful pollutants into the Midwest's rivers, lakes and streams.

For example:

	In Illinois, the Havana Power Station discharged more than 1,000 pounds of lead into waters that flow into the Illinois River;
	In Ohio,  the Cardinal Power Station discharged 11,500 pounds of arsenic into waters that flow into the Ohio River; and
	In Indiana, the Petersburg Generating Station discharged 5,700 pounds of arsenic and 1,200 pounds of lead into waters that flow into the White River.

We urge that EPA uphold compliance deadlines established as part of the Toxic Water Rule. Coal-fired power plants have had a free pass to pollute our drinking water, aquatic life habitats and recreational water sources for too long. They have put the health of downstream communities and economies at risk. Because of this reckless practice:

	Across the Midwest, health departments have advisories warning against eating locally caught fish that are contaminated with heavy metals.
	45% of waterways that receive coal plant wastewater are contaminated with high levels of heavy metals or other harmful pollutants.
	Toxic chemicals in coal plant wastewater such as mercury, lead, and arsenic can cause cancer and other health problems.
	These chemicals concentrate up the food chain resulting in long-term damage to aquatic ecosystems.

The compliance dates included in the 2015 final Toxic Water Rule are necessary for achieving clean safe drinking water, habitats for aquatic life, and safe and better recreation and tourism throughout the Midwest.

Attached are 166 comments opposing the delay in compliance deadlines, from ELPC members and supporters from across the Midwest and beyond.

We appreciate EPA's consideration of these comments.

Respectfully submitted,

RE: Postponement of Certain Compliance Dates for the Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category

Dear Administrator Pruitt:

Clean Water Action is submitting the more than two thousand attached comments from our members around the country, urging EPA to not delay any of the compliance deadlines for the 2015 Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category nor propose to weaken any of the pollution limits required in these final standards.

Before the 2015 final standards were issued, effluent guidelines and standards for steam electric power plants had not been updated since 1982 and contained no limits on arsenic, lead, mercury, and other harmful pollutants. EPA issued the final ELG rule in 2015 after an extensive rulemaking process, which included numerous technical and scientific studies and hundreds of thousands of public comments, the majority in support of eliminating toxic water pollution from power plants.

Affordable technologies exist today that can eliminate nearly all of this pollution - in fact, many plants are already using it, and the remaining plants must upgrade to these 21st century technologies. The standards finalized in 2015 were already long overdue and any further delay will result in more polluted streams and lakes that are unsafe for fishing and place additional public health risk on communities that rely on drinking water sources downstream of coal fired power plants.

We urge you to not delay any of the compliance deadlines for the final 2015 standards and guidelines for steam electric power plants, nor propose to weaken any of the pollution limits required in these final standards.

Don't postpone compliance for Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards for Steam Electric Power Plants (EPA-HQ-OW-2009-0819)

Dear Administrator Pruitt,

I am writing to share my deep disappointment at your proposal to put an indefinite hold on compliance for the Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards for Steam Electric Power Plants. This 2015 rule was a long-overdue update to protect our communities, families, and environment from lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium and many other dangerous toxic pollutants that coal-fired power plants dump into our waters. Power plants are by far the largest source of toxic pollution in the U.S. and have contaminated over 23,000 miles of rivers. These toxins are linked to cancer and neurological damage, and they bioaccumulate in fish and wildlife, further harming public health.

I urge you to reconsider this damaging proposal. The 2015 Steam Electric Effluent Limitation Guidelines rule for the first time addressed the serious problem of toxic pollution from power plant wastewater. We simply cannot continue to ignore this problem.

I urge the EPA to finalize the strongest proposed standards for power plant pollution to protect our waterways. I believe that the power generation industry needs to be accountable for the toxic waste dumped into our rivers and streams.
 
Best available technology should be used to keep the public safe, because the water we rely on can no longer be a dumping ground. By far the best option proposed by EPA is for power plants to install zero liquid discharge technology and convert to safer coal ash handling systems that will eliminate discharges of the most contaminated wastewaters entirely.
 
Too many streams, lakes and rivers have been poisoned by power plant water pollution. The EPA should protect local communities from this pollution by adopting the strongest possible safeguards.","Rulemaking for the Steam Electric Power Generating Effluent Limitations Guidelines"

We write in support of the inclusion of an added sugars declaration in the proposed changes to the Nutrition Facts label.  

As scientists, physicians, public health officials, and food and nutrition experts, we believe that the quantifying and labeling of added sugars in foods is an important step toward better health in the United States. 

Studies increasingly point to the overconsumption of sugar in this country as a major contributing factor in rising health risks for metabolic syndrome, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, lipid abnormalities, and hypertension. In 2012, the U.S. per capita daily sugar consumption was 82 grams—far more sugar consumption than recommended by the World Health Organization and the American Heart Association.  More must be done to address our sugar overconsumption in order to improve the health of all Americans.

This cannot be solved without public education. Many food and beverage manufacturers add excessive amounts of sugar to their products, including those that they market as healthy options. In our current food environment, many people are unknowingly and unavoidably consuming excess sugar. Given our soaring rates of chronic diseases and the link between sugar and these diseases, citizens have a right to know how much sugar has been added to their foods.

While we strongly urge the FDA to retain the added sugar declaration in the proposed label, adding an absolute number of added grams of sugar to the label means less to the consumer if there is no upper limit, as delineated by a percent daily value (%DV). As long as there is no upper limit on sugar consumption, the public will remain confused. While %DV usually refers to minimum thresholds, there is precedent for %DV referring to maxima as well. The United Kingdom instituted maxima on salt in the last decade, and has seen reductions in hypertension and stroke. The World Health Organization recommends at most 50 grams or 10% of total calories from added sugar, and the American Heart Association recommends an even more stringent limit of 25 g for women and 37.5g for men.

Food manufacturers can measure the sugar they add to food. The proposed rule provides flexibility in measurement accuracy and offers alternative methods for products where sugar content is affected by fermentation. This is reasonable to ask of food manufacturers and the FDA should not delay in their implementation of the final rule. Moreover, proprietary information will be protected under the proposed rule; thus, manufacturers need not be concerned with confidentiality.

Voluntary labeling, such as Facts Up Front, can play a limited role in consumer education; however, such measures are insufficient as they are not uniformly implemented, can confuse consumers, and do not declare added sugars. Standardized changes to the Nutrition Facts label requiring the declaration of added sugars are necessary for consumer right to know.

Added sugar labeling would help to counter advertising and misinformation. In 2012, the ten largest U.S. food and beverage companies spent more than $6.9 billion in U.S. advertising to promote their high sugar megabrands. Sugar-sweetened beverages, in particular are a major source of excess sugar for many Americans. These same companies spend more than $1 billion dollars advertising their beverages alone.

We urge you to include a declaration of added sugar in your implementation of the proposed updates to the Nutrition Facts label, as well as attach a limit of 10% of daily calorie intake to it. Such a move would allow citizens to make more informed choices and help to promote health for all Americans.

Limiting carbon pollution from coal power plants doesn?t just help us fight climate change, the EPA has previously reported that the Clean Power Plan would prevent 90,000 asthma attacks, 300,000 missed work and school days, and 3,600 premature deaths annually by 2030. 

Dismantling or repealing the Clean Power Plan, will put the health and well-being of our communities, especially communities of color and low-income families that bear the brunt of climate impacts, further at risk. Millions of Americans count on the government to help protect them from crisis and public health disasters. This is one of those moments: Please do not rescind or dismantle the Clean Power Plan.""

The Climate Reality Project believes that any rule to replace America's historic Clean Power Plan must promote clean energy over dirty fossil fuels and protect our health and our environment. Our staff has worked to raise awareness about the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) comment period and encourage our supporters to stand up for strong regulations on the climate change-driving harmful emissions from power plants. The 12,653 comments attached reflect signatures gathered online from our supporters across the country demanding the government prioritize clean energy over fossil fuels, as stated by this language presented to signees:

We strongly oppose repealing the Clean Power Plan.

Poll after poll shows that the overwhelming majority of Americans want the government to confront the climate crisis head-on by shifting from dirty fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. When EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan, over 4.3 million Americans spoke up to support it. 

The message couldn't be any clearer: We want a clean energy economy. 

The Clean Power Plan is an example of the federal government listening to the American people and taking action. By repealing it, we allow carbon pollution and toxic emissions from the power sector to continue driving climate change and causing health issues for the most vulnerable among us. And we compromise the continued growth of the booming clean energy and efficiency industry that already employs 2.8 million Americans - more than oil, coal, and gas combined.

The Clean Power Plan lays out a legal system designed to be flexible, using legal precedent to offer power plants the option of fulfilling their goals by shifting generation to clean energy off-site. This is the most cost-effective and best way for utilities to reduce emissions by the level necessary to tackle the climate crisis. 

A clean energy economy is good for our planet, our families, and our health. We strongly oppose repealing the Clean Power Plan and call on EPA to act on climate for the sake of all Americans.

The Climate Reality Project and its many supporters demand that the Environmental Protection Agency live up to its mission of protecting our health and environment by cutting carbon pollution from power plants and encouraging clean energy development.

Enclosed please find 5,157 individual public comments collected by Jobs With Justice for submission to the Department of Labor regarding the proposed rule on overtime pay. Individual comments differ, although most read as follows: 

""As someone who cares about working families in this country, I support the Obama administration's proposal to raise the overtime threshold and guarantee that hard work receives fair compensation. The current threshold - $23,660 a year - sits below the poverty line for a family of four, yet the men and women earning these salaries can be asked to work dozens of extra hours each week with no additional pay. Raising the overtime threshold to $50,440 a year will help ensure that millions of hardworking people are no longer forced to work long hours without additional pay.""

Dear Ms. Ziegler:

Attached please find 183 individual public comments collected by the Economic Policy Institute for submission to the Department of Labor's proposed rulemaking on overtime pay. The comments read as follows: 

""President Obama and the U.S. Department of Labor are proposing to raise the overtime thresholdwhat you can be paid and still qualify for ""time-and-a-half"" beyond 40 hours per week from $23,600 a year to $50,400. This is a BIG deal. Because of it, about 13 million workers will get a raise.

But if the National Retail Federationwhich includes Walmarthas their way, workers might not ever see a dime of that extra overtime pay.

That's because the National Retail Federation, the National Association of Home Builders, and other corporate lobbyists are trying to run out the clock. Their first step: get the Department of Labor to extend the public comment period by 90 more days. If these corporate lobbyists succeed, they'll stop the new overtime pay rules from taking effect before the holidaysand possibly delay implementation indefinitely.

Join the Economic Policy Institute, Democracy for America, and Robert Reich to tell the Department of Labor: Don't delay overtime pay one day more.""

This plan is a courageous step in the right direction. It's like a minimum wage hike for the middle class.

Since 1975 we have seen the effective wages of American workers decline. One of the reasons for this is that the overtime threshold has not kept pace with inflation. Workers are not receiving the benefits of their labor and as a result, wages have stagnated or in some cases fallen. The proposed rule would go a long way in addressing this disparity, strengthening our economy by providing more income to households that they can turn around and spend at businesses, creating new jobs and growing our GDP.

Dear Secretary Zinke,

Please find attached a file containing 10,937 signatories to our advocacy petition encouraging your agency to protect the Bureau of Land Management's Methane Waste Prevention Rule. 

In partnership with The Wilderness Society, members of Care2.com have signed on to some version of the text below:*

====
I oppose the proposal to gut the Bureau of Land Management's Methane Waste Prevention Rule. 

Methane waste and pollution is a serious problem on public lands. Leaking, venting, and flaring from natural gas facilities wastes hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer owned natural resources every year. The new proposal eliminates key provisions, which protect against exposure to dangerous pollutants and promotes the waste of 299 billion cubic feet of natural gas, enough energy to heat nearly 500,000 homes each year for the next ten years. In addition, your proposal is a huge step backward on the fight to tackle climate change, resulting in the same amount of short-term climate damage as 8.3 million cars driven over ten years. 

Rolling back the Methane and Waste Prevention Rule results in a free pass to oil and gas companies to waste American energy and pollute on our public lands. Capturing wasted gas would promote responsible energy production and job growth while safeguarding American health and royalty revenue. 

I urge you to halt the effort to gut the rule and instead protect our public lands, health and pocketbooks from methane waste and pollution.

Nearly 4,000 people have taken the time to write a personalized comment and all 30,883 have signed to the following text:

Im strongly opposed to the recent proposal to weaken critical methane pollution protections. 

Since 2013, more than $1.7 billion worth of fracked gas has been leaked, vented, or flared on public and tribal lands. Leaked gas contains volatile organic compounds, benzene, and other hazardous air pollutants that are known carcinogens and asthma irritants. 

BLMs current methane rule is a win-win solution that keeps American communities safe from methane and other toxic pollution resulting from oil and gas activity while ensuring that public resources are managed in the public interest. Reducing leaks, venting, and flaring curbs dangerous pollution, and proper management of these public resources ensures the revenue the Bureau of Land Management collects benefits local schools and infrastructure. 

I urge you to stand with the American people and the communities whose health will be harmed by this new proposal. Please leave in place the current standards that effectively protect Americans' health, safety, and ensure responsible management of public resources.

We respectfully request the comments submitted by the individuals listed in the attached document are reflected in the final comment tally for this docket.

The comment they each submitted reads: 

I am writing today in strong opposition to BLM's recent proposal to weaken crucial methane waste protections.

This proposal gives the oil and gas industry permission to continue to waste a precious resource. It's also a dangerous decision that puts polluters before our families. 

As a parent, I am concerned about the health impacts of methane pollution, which is a dangerous greenhouse gas. By weakening the limits on the amount of methane pollution that the oil and gas industry is allowed to vent, leak and burn, the health and future of American families and our children are being jeopardized. 

Without public hearings, our voices aren't being heard. Please establish public hearings across the West so that the Americans affected by this proposal can give their input.

Children should be protected from the health risks that come from oil and gas infrastructure, including exposure to air pollution linked to heart and lung disease, pregnancy complications, cancer, and more. Now is the time to strengthen, not dismantle, the protections that keep our families and communities safe.

I implore you and the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management to enforce the strong protections against wasteful pollution that American families deserve.

Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns about this submission.

To Whom It May Concern,


As Pro-Life Christians, we want the air that we breathe to be safe for our children.  That's why we call on Secretary Zinke to keep strong methane standards on BLM managed lands.  Without strong standards to prevent toxic pollutants like methane from poisoning our air, we are putting the worst actors in the oil and gas industry ahead of our children's health.  Secretary Zinke, enforce our current standards for the health of our children, and don't weaken them.  Our children deserve nothing less.

For several years, we have urged the EPA to set the RVO at an effective 15 billion gallons for conventional renewable fuel, as intended by Congress.  We appreciate that EPA has proposed to do so in this rule. EPA's proposal for conventional ethanol is good for farmers who are facing tough economic times and good for consumers who want affordable fuel choices that give us a cleaner environment. 

While I am pleased EPA proposed a conventional fuel volume consistent with the law, I am concerned that EPA proposed to lower the total RVO, as well as the cellulosic and advanced volumes, below the final volumes set for 2017. With many current ethanol producers investing in bolt-on technologies to produce cellulosic ethanol from existing facilities, corn farmers want to ensure that the final 2018 RVO continues to expand the market and draw investment for cellulosic biofuels and other advanced fuels.  Rather than reducing volumes, we ask EPA to take a more forward-looking approach that considers continued growth in the cellulosic and advanced fuels sectors in the final rule. 

I believe the Renewable Fuel Standard has been a resounding success, resulting in cleaner air, greater energy independence, and stronger rural communities. Please keep the RFS moving forward in line with the law.  Doing so will yield greater stability and certainty in the marketplace and spur increased investment in homegrown renewable fuels.

"2759",226976,39729,NA,NA,"Mass Comment Campaign sponsored by Mighty Earth (web)","Mighty Earth is pleased to provide you with the following list of citizens who are signed a public comment to the EPA in favor of lowering production levels for soy and palm biodiesel and corn ethanol production, in order to protect some of the world's last, great forests and other native ecosystems. 17,951 of these comments are from United States signatories and 21,721 are international.
 
The following is the text of the comment to Administrator Scott Pruitt: 
 
Dear Administrator Pruitt,
 
I am writing to ask you to lower mandated production levels for soy and palm biodiesel and corn ethanol under the Renewable Fuel Standard. Increasing agricultural production for soy and palm biodiesel drives the deforestation of sensitive and valuable forest ecosystems around the world, and corn ethanol threatens native landscapes in the U.S.
 
Forests in Brazil, Bolivia, Indonesia and throughout Latin America and Southeast Asia are known for their beautiful, ecologically important habitats. These places are home to many threatened and endangered species, including the tree kangaroo, orangutan, jaguar and giant anteater.
 
Furthermore, by taking up and storing carbon dioxide, these forests provide an important bulwark against climate change.
 
Unfortunately, to meet growing demand for soy and palm oils, agri-businesses continue to carve out new farms from virgin forest. In the Brazilian Amazon, areas planted with soy have more than tripled in the last 10 years to approximately 3.6 million hectares. Bolivia expects to clear 14 million additional acres for farmland by 2025. In Indonesia, a single company, Korindo, has a target of deforesting 200,000 hectares for oil palm plantations by 2020.
 
When forest clearance is fully considered, biodiesel has no carbon reduction benefits. In fact, a recent analysis based on European Union research found that biodiesel made from soy and palm oil have significantly higher climate emissions than fossil diesel.
 
Growing corn for ethanol has similar problems, and its effects are seen here in the U.S. The dramatic increase in corn production and has contributed to more the conversion of more than 7 million acres of native ecosystems into agricultural land since 2007.
 
Promoting soy and palm biodiesel and corn ethanol threatens critical habitats at and abroad and makes it harder to deliver on our climate benchmarks. Because of this, I encourage your agency to lower biodiesel and corn ethanol production.","Renewable Fuel Standard Program: Standards for 2018 and Biomass-Based Diesel Volume for 2019"

To protect vulnerable populations of monarchs, bees and other pollinators that depend on native grasslands, I ask that your agency acknowledge the severe environmental impacts of corn ethanol production and adjust your final Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandate downward.

Native grasslands are disappearing at an alarming rate, along with the monarch butterfly and other wildlife species that depend on them. Studies show the RFS increases demand for corn, contributing to the conversion of millions of acres. The agency acknowledged the impact of biodiesel on deforestation abroad -- yet it has not done the same for habitat loss here at home. Please defend, don't destroy habitat for monarchs and many other species. Reduce the mandate for corn ethanol and soy biodiesel. 

Additionally, I ask that EPA implement the land conversion protections contained in the law. The RFS includes protections against converting untilled lands for biofuel production. Yet EPA has not implemented this provision as Congress intended. Given the threats to remaining grasslands and the steep declines of monarchs and other wildlife, the land-clearing provision must be enforced to fully protect these critically important habitats.

These two actions together would put us on a better path to meeting our goals for cleaner fuel that does not make it harder to bring monarchs back from the brink. Thank you.

These individuals are concerned about the rapid loss of tropical rainforests and wildlife habitat, and ask that domestic production of biodiesel NOT increase, in order to mitigate feedstock diversion. Diverting domestically-grown oils and fats from food and industrial use to fuel use creates a market opening for imported palm oil. Typically, palm oil is the cheapest replacement and its imports have recently jumped, in tandem with soy oil diversions for biodiesel use. 

Text of citizen comment letter as follows:  

Dear Administrator Pruitt,

I am writing to ask you to lower mandated production levels for biodiesel under the Renewable Fuel Standard, to avoid increasing demand for vegetable oil crops driving massive deforestation in places like Argentina and Indonesia. 

The recent decision to levy tariffs against Argentinian and Indonesian biodiesel was a step in the right direction. However, if the overall biodiesel mandate level is not brought in line with current domestic production, we could face an enormous spike in domestic production. 

And unfortunately, even domestic biodiesel production is tied to the destruction of tropical rainforests in Southeast Asia. The more domestically grown oils are shifted from food products to fuel, the more palm oil is imported to fill the gap. 
Please protect our planet's last, great forests by reducing biodiesel mandate levels.

"2766",220956,188,NA,NA,"Mass Comment Campaign sponsoring organization unknown (web)","The proposed Particulate Matter standard is yet another example of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) forcing expensive mandates on states, coal-based electricity and the mining community.  EPA is rushing to judgment with this rule, and has entered into a consent decree with environmental groups against the best interests of the public.


Designation as a non-attainment area for PM2.5 has immediate and potentially severe consequences for local jurisdictions in the form of straining already thin local resources while simultaneously driving away manufacturing and investment.  Restrictive regulations such as this one discourage industrial and commercial activity in and around a non-attainment area.  This will stifle job growth in a business's local community.  The resulting reductions in property tax collections will also impair localities' capacity to provide crucial services like public safety and education.


EPA's proposed rule will also impact the mining community through stricter nonattainment standards, the retention of an overly stringent limit for coarse particulates, and the impossibly dense secondary visibly standard.


I urge EPA to withdraw and reconsider the proposed Particulate Matter standard.

We need clean air every day (RE: EPA ID: EPA-HQ-OAR-2010-0682-0872)

Dear Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards:

Continue to show your commitment for overburdened communities and vulnerable children now, when it most counts--we need national air toxics limits for refineries to apply at all times, not just when it's convenient for oil companies.

I strongly urge the EPA to strengthen protections against toxic pollution from petroleum refineries and resist industry pressure to reduce the effectiveness of important new requirements like fenceline monitoring.

	The EPA must protect refinery communities and remove all of the FREE PASSES TO POLLUTE that would allow oil corporations to poison our air without any consequences. There are widely available and cost-effective ways to reduce toxic air pollution from oil refineries. Many releases are preventable through better maintenance and monitoring, and better control of the equipment. Equipment to prevent pollution while also conserving energy is also widely available. 
	The EPA limits must apply at all times, to hold polluters accountable and give oil refineries the incentive to clean up the air and prevent upsets and malfunctions, instead of allowing uncontrolled pollution releases from smoking flares or pressure-relief devices.
	Health threats from refineries' toxic air pollution are too high. The scientific evidence and the EPA's policies confirm this. I am calling on the EPA to reconsider its refusal to prevent more cancer caused by oil refinery pollution. For communities in the shadow of refineries, every extra human cancer case and every moment a child has difficult breathing due to exposure to refinery pollution is unacceptable--especially on top of all of the other health and safety threats from refineries. 
	The EPA must not allow refineries to reduce or stop air monitoring that communities need, and should not give in to industry pressure to weaken the national standards in the ways industry groups have asked the EPA to do.

I support the EPA's full implementation of important improvements in the standards--including limits on certain sources of toxic pollution at refineries and a first-ever requirement for all refineries to monitor, report and address fugitive emissions of benzene crossing their fencelines into neighboring communities. To be able to breathe freely, communities need the EPA to finish the job now, before it's too late, by exercising strong leadership and fulfilling its obligations under the law to remove all loopholes and prevent refineries from escaping fundamental clean air safeguards for public health. 

We now have a rare opportunity to make our air cleaner and communities safer by finishing the important work the EPA started to control oil refinery pollution. Please seal the EPA's and President Obama's legacy by removing exemptions and showing that you stand with communities that need protection from toxic air pollution and the health and safety problems it causes every single day, not just some days. Please take action now to reduce harm to children living in the shadows of our nation's oil refineries, by preventing all uncontrolled pollution releases and removing this danger to public health.

Sincerely,

Finalize strong Regional Haze Rule updates: Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2015-0531
Dear Administrator McCarthy,

Thank you for proposing important updates to the Regional Haze Rule. As we celebrate the National Park Service's Centennial, we are reminded of just how valuable clean and healthy parks are for the millions of visitors and local economies that depend on the tourism. 

Our national parks are some of our most special and iconic public treasures. Unfortunately, too many of them suffer from poor air quality that not only hinders views and diminishes experiences, but also threatens the health and well-being of visitors and wildlife. 

I urge you to finalize the strongest possible revisions to the Regional Haze Rule. Please reject language that would allow known polluters to avoid or delay cleaning up their harmful emissions. The program must ensure parks are on a clear and certain path to pollution reductions, and states must be held accountable for their contributions to dangerous haze pollution. I also support giving the National Park Service a more meaningful role in the process to ensure that those who know the parks the best are able to help craft the strongest protections. 

I hope you will use every tool at your disposal to ensure polluters are held accountable and that our parks are cleaned up in a prompt and timely fashion. 

Thank you for your work and consideration.

We are grateful that you are taking action to protect our national parks and wilderness areas from haze pollution. The proposed amendments to the regional haze rule are a critical step in tackling harmful health pollutants and ensuring that everyone's next trip to a national park will include clear skies and the ability to enjoy the natural beauty our national parks were intended to preserve. 

Thank you for helping to ensure that every state does its fair share to protect our national parks and wilderness areas from haze pollution. Preserving our parks and wilderness areas should come before political posturing and maneuvering, which often lets the biggest and dirtiest polluters off the hook.

However, we are concerned about several provisions in the current proposal, including:
	Extending the deadline for states to submit their next round of haze cleanup plans by three years
	Potentially allowing states nearly a decade to avoid cleaning up sources of air pollution specifically identified by federal land managers as causing impairment of protected national parks and wilderness areas
	Weakening the ability of EPA and the public to force corrective action if states fall behind in achieving their pollution reduction obligations

States can and should meet their current deadlines for preparing plans to clean up haze pollution. We need tighter enforcement, not more leniency.

The Regional Haze Rule has made progress in improving the air quality and visibility, but we must continue to set high standards to restore natural visibility at America's national parks and wilderness areas. The proposed revision of the Regional Haze Rule is a step in the right direction, but it should be strengthened by addressing the shortcomings described above.

Thank you for helping to protect our national parks during their centennial year.

Sincerely,
 
Josh McNeil
Executive Director, Conservation Voters of PA

Docket # EPA-HQ-OEM-2015-0725

Dear Acting Administrator Wheeler:

Im writing to oppose the Environmental Protection Agencys rollbacks of the Chemical Disaster Rule.
Each year, an average of 150 fires, leaks, explosions and other incidents occur at chemical plants. The
Chemical Disaster Rule helps protect workers and communities, yet the EPA is proposing to repeal all of
the disaster prevention measures. The EPA should keep and implement the full Chemical Disaster Rule.
Along the Gulf Coast, Hurricane Harvey proved how devastating it can be when natural disasters impact
chemical facilities. The EPA should be working to prevent catastrophic incidents, especially as the risk for
extreme weather events is on the rise.

The EPA claims that the chemical industry will save $88 million/year through these repeals  a tiny
amount for the industry. But when a chemical disaster happens again  and it will  a single event can
cause $220 million in harm. The cost of doing business should include the cost of operating safely.
The EPA must not weaken or delay emergency response requirements, nor should it deny chemical
hazard information to exposed communities. Make companies use safer, less hazardous chemicals and
put into place more robust preparation, planning and incident review.

Sincerely,

To Whom It May Concern:

Please find 414 comments attached for inclusion in this docket, EPA-HQ-OEM-2015-0725-0890, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs Under the Clean Air Act regarding proposed rescissions of EPAs Chemical Disaster Rule. More than 40 people have taken the time to write a personalized comment and 371 have signed to the following text:

Weakening the Chemical Disaster Rule (EPA-HQ-OEM-2015-0725-0890) will endanger workers, first responders, and the communities surrounding industrial facilities that handle hazardous chemicals. 

Roughly 177 million Americans live close enough to an industrial facility to be affected by a chemical accident, and that risk falls disproportionately on low-income and minority communities. One-in-three schoolchildren currently attend a school in the vulnerability zone for an industrial chemical accident, meaning they are potentially in the path of a lethal industrial chemical release. Workers are greatest risk of injury or death, alongside first responders, who put their lives on the line responding to the industrial fires, explosions, and chemical releases that occur 150 times on average each year across the nation. 

The Chemical Disaster Rule (Amendments to the Accidental Release Prevention Requirements for Risk Management Programs (RMP) under the Clean Air Act), finalized in January 2017, provided critically needed safeguards. The EPAs proposal to weaken the rule will eliminate key provisions that require companies to coordinate with emergency responders; analyze accidents to determine how to prevent them in the future; share information with communities on hazards at the facility and preparedness procedures; conduct independent audits for serious chemical accidents; and, for the most dangerous subset of facilities, evaluate safer technologies and practices so that if an accident occurs (whatever the cause), fewer people will be killed or injured.

EPAs proposal reflects a disregard for the safety of American workers and the millions of Americansincluding school childrenwho work or live in the danger zone of these facilities. I urge you to withdraw EPAs current proposal and implement the Chemical Disaster Rule in its original January 2017 form.

We respectfully request that the 414 comments submitted by the individuals in the attached document be reflected in the final comment tally for this docket.

Millions of Americans live, attend school, and work within the zone of vulnerability of hazardous chemical facilities, putting them at risk of disaster in the event of a chemical release incident. The Risk Management Program Amendments include rules and regulations invaluable to the safety of families and communities all over the country. I strongly urge you not to rescind and modify the RMP Amendments, to keep Americans safe from chemical catastrophe.

The Risk Management Program Amendments were designed by the EPA in response to significant risk to the safety of American workers and communities. The EPAs own findings defined an urgent need for the common-sense updates and regulations the amendments outline.

When the implementation of the amendments was delayed, devastating chemical disasters continued to occur. Its clear that the EPAs original findings, which informed the construction of the RMP Amendments in the first place, remain relevant -- and the RMP Amendments remain as necessary as ever.

Rescinding the RMP Amendments not only needlessly puts millions of Americans at risk from chemical catastrophe, but also bizarrely disregards the prior work of the EPA on this important subject. In order to prevent future tragedies, the RMP Amendments must be kept in place. 

With millions of American lives at risk every day from facilities covered under the RMP Amendments, this rule is no place to attempt to cut costs or corners.

The proposed Risk Management Plan (RMP) Amendments reduce protections from chemical plant accidents with disproportionate impact on people of color and low-income communities. The rollback, if adopted, will directly subvert the goals and commitments of Executive Order 12898 [Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations]. As stated by the Environmental Justice Health Alliance for Chemical Policy Reform,

 Rather than serving to improve on-the-ground results for overburdened communities through reduced impacts, the action will increase hazards and impacts in these communities, as documented in EPAs Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) of the action;
 Instead of institutionaliz[ing] environmental justice [EJ] integration in EPA decision-making, the action will proceed without addressing EJ issues or providing for meaningful involvement of affected communities;
 Rather than strengthening the agencys ability to take action on environmental justice and cumulative impacts, the action will eliminate regulatory elements and tools that would have helped address these impacts;
 Instead of deepen[ing] environmental justice practice within EPA programs to improve the health and environment of overburdened communities, the action will ignore EJ consideration requirements and worsened the health and environment of EJ communities by the agencys own hand;
 Rather than work[ing] with partners to expand our positive impact within overburdened communities, the action will create negative impacts and has been developed while the agency refuses to respond to EJ community requests for meaningful involvement.

Eliminating or weakening the Chemical Disaster Rule (EPA-HQ-OEM-2015-0725-0890) would put industrial workers, first responders, and communities living near chemical facilities that use hazardous chemicals at risk. 

The Chemical Disaster Rule (Amendments to the Accidental Release Prevention Requirements for Risk Management Programs (RMP) under the Clean Air Act) provides vital safeguards for over 12,500 facilities that handle hazardous chemicals. This proposal would remove important requirements that help prevent, and appropriately prepare for, deadly chemical accidents. These include important components such as coordination with local emergency responders, investigations of accidents to prevent future disasters, independent third-party audits, and evaluating safer technology and practices that could decrease the number of people injured or killed if a problem occurs at one of these facilities. 

Currently, over 177 million Americans live, work, and go to school close enough to an industrial facility to feel the impacts of a chemical accident. Low-income and minority communities are disproportionately represented in this group. Between 2004 and 2013, there were over 1,500 reported chemical releases or explosions at RMP-covered facilities. Workers at these facilities work in potentially dangerous situations every day, and first responders put their lives on the line without proper information when an accident occurs. 

I urge the EPA to put the lives of children, workers, first responders, and countless communities over the interests of the oil and chemical industry by withdrawing this dangerous proposal to weaken these protections by rescinding amendments and changing compliance dates.","Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs Under the Clean Air Act"

As Americans who live within a zip code of one of the nation's high-risk chemical facilities, we urge the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to not delay or roll back the improvements made to the Risk Management Program (RMP).

The first revision in more than 20 years to the RMP was shaped by years of rigorous research and public input and was motivated by the legal responsibility of the EPA to mitigate the injuries, lives lost, and property damage of chemical accidents throughout the country. Any attempt to delay or weaken the RMP sacrifices the health and safety of our families, emergency responders, workers, and nearby communities, who are often low-income communities and communities of color already bearing the burden of environmental hazard.

We ask the EPA to take its mission and legally-mandated responsibility seriously and to embrace the amendments to the RMP rule that will reduce risks associated with and improve emergency response to catastrophic chemical facility incidents.

Protect communities from chemical disasters (Docket ID: EPA-HQ-OEM-2015-0725)

Dear Administrator McCarthy,

Thank you for recognizing the need to set stronger chemical safety standards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must use its full legal authority and commonsense measures to protect workers and communities from chemical disasters.

The EPA must immediately use its authority under the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act to prevent future chemical disasters. Any commonsense strategy for reducing chemical disasters should include an EPA requirement that chemical facilities both assess safer measures and also put them in place. Voluntary guidelines are not getting the job done to protect workers and communities. It's not fair for the burden of hazardous releases to fall only on workers, vulnerable communities and first responders who have little or no ability to protect themselves and their families once a chemical disaster is in progress. That's why the EPA must exercise its authority and fulfill its responsibility to act under the Clean Air Act's ""Bhopal"" provisions in section 112(r)(1) and 112 (r)(7) to require refineries and chemical facilities to use the safest cost-effective chemical process available to eliminate the potential for catastrophic chemical releases.

A report by the Environmental Justice and Health Alliance for Chemical Policy Reform (cosponsored by Coming Clean and the Center for Effective Government) highlighted that more than 134 million Americans live in the danger zones around 3,433 facilities that store or use highly hazardous chemicals. Most in danger are the 3.8 million people living at the fence line of these facilities. How many more news headlines and how much more preventable suffering must our country endure before the EPA uses its power to hold chemical facilities accountable for safe operations? 

The threat posed by chemical disasters is more acutely felt by residents of communities of color. Specifically, the EJHA report found that Blacks are 75 percent more likely than the greater U.S. population as a whole to live in fenceline zones near chemical facilities. Latinos are 60 percent more likely to live in fenceline communities.

The final rule should:

	Finalize the EPA's proposed requirement for a safer alternatives assessment by certain oil refineries, chemical manufacturers and paper plants to determine the availability of safer available chemical processes and/or inherently safer technologies (IST); require this assessment to be reported to EPA, and strengthen transparency for the affected public; require this assessment to occur expeditiously, not wait another five years; and apply the assessment requirement to all hazardous-release industries covered by Clean Air Act section 112(r).
	Prioritize protection of the most vulnerable populations, including workers, nearby communities and first responders. 
	Require all refineries and chemical facilities to reduce the use of the most toxic substances where alternatives are available, and implement other safer practices, like backup power, to prevent catastrophic accidents.|
	Engage workers in the alternatives and feasibility assessment process and ensure they have whistleblower protections and anonymous reporting.
	Require and strengthen hazardous leak detection and require fenceline monitoring at all hazardous facilities to ensure prompt action is taken when a release occurs and to give communities and first responders near hazardous facilities real-time information on hazards as they begin to happen, instead of just after the fact.

Preventing chemical disasters could be part of the Obama administration's legacy if you strengthen and finalize this rule to address the safety threat that refineries and other chemical facilities pose to both workers and communities.

Dear Director McCarthy:

Attached, please find the name of 450 members and supporters of Public Citizen Texas who signed onto the following statement: 

The EPA must increase protections against catastrophic releases of hazardous chemicals by requiring facilities using those chemicals to study the use of safer technologies. The EPA should go further than its proposed rule by requiring all facilities that are possible sources of such disasters to study safer technologies, not just facilities in a handful of industries.

And the EPA should actually require companies to use feasible safer technologies that they identify in the required studies. Studying safer technologies will only benefit the public if companies have to use those technologies when they can.

The EPA should also make sure that the public knows about the hazards posed by facilities near them and about the efforts those facilities have made, or not made, to reduce the risk. And companies should be required to conduct disaster drills on a frequent basis, and should be required to implement any new rules the EPA issues as soon as possible, not years in the future.

Your proposed rule needs to be tougher and better!

Attached is a document containing the signatures of 33,363 Environmental Defense Fund supporters from across the country who have submitted electronic comments regarding EPA's Regulation of Certain Uses under Toxic Substances Control Act: Methylene Chloride and N-Methylpyrrolidone. The comment they each submitted reads: 

""I'm writing today to strongly urge EPA to finalize its rules to ban high-risk uses of trichloroethylene (TCE), methylene chloride (DCM), and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) under the new Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).  

These chemicals are extremely toxic. TCE is carcinogenic and can cause heart defects in the developing fetus.  DCM is a very lethal chemical  over the past few decades, dozens of workers have died from using DCM-based paint stripping products.  NMP is often used as a substitute for DCM in paint stripping products, yet it also presents major health risks  ranging from developmental and reproductive toxicity to neurotoxicity to liver and kidney damage. 

EPA had not successfully banned a chemical under the original TSCA in nearly three decades.  Now, with its greater authority under the new TSCA as amended by the Lautenberg Act, EPA can score an early public health victory by banning these toxic chemicals for these high-risk uses.  

But the chemical industry is complaining and pressuring EPA to back off, delay, or weaken these much needed rules.  Some in industry are suggesting that measures like putting a simple label on these deadly products or requiring workers to wear protective gear would suffice.  But labels, personal protective equipment, and concentration limits are not enough to protect my family and community.

I strongly urge the Agency to stay on track and promptly ban TCE used as a spot cleaning agent in dry cleaning, as an aerosol spray degreaser in commercial and consumer settings, and as a vapor degreaser in commercial settings, and both DCM and NMP used for commercial and consumer paint stripping. Safer alternatives are already widely available. 

There is simply no excuse to continue putting my family's and my community's health at risk by delaying or weakening these rules.""

RE: Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OPPT-2016-0231-0001

May 19, 2017

To Whom It May Concern:

Attached are comments from Clean Water Action members urging the EPA to ban commercial and consumer uses of the toxic chemicals methylene chloride (DCM) and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) in paint and coating removal, because chemicals linked to cancer, developmental toxicity, and other health impacts don't belong on store shelves.

Safer alternatives are readily availablebut we need EPA to ban both of these chemicals from the products available on store shelves and in the workplace. While EPA has proposed two options for regulating NMP, the best option for public health is a ban on NMP and DCM.

Since our founding during the campaign to pass the landmark Clean Water Act in 1972, Clean Water Action has worked to win strong health and environmental protections by bringing issue expertise, solution-oriented thinking and people power to the table. On behalf of our members who submitted comments, and the remainder of our one million members across the country, we urge you to please move quickly to ban these toxic chemicals.

Sincerely,

Sample Comment: 

Deny Dow AgroScience's application to expand the registration of sulfoxaflor (Docket ID:
EPA-HQ-OPP-2014-0156).

Thank you for considering my input.

As a citizen concerned about our nation's health and food security, I urge you to deny Dow AgroScience's application to expand the registration of the bee-killing pesticide sulfoxaflor so that it can be sprayed on corn, alfalfa, oats, and several significant and widely grown crops.

Honeybees are dying at rates unprecedented in history, prompting the U.S. Department of Agriculture to warn that it is no longer confident in our ability to ""meet the pollination demands of U.S. agricultural crops."" Rather than expand the number of crops that can be sprayed with highly toxic and systemic insecticides like sulfoxaflor, the EPA must take immediate steps to help bees recover. I join with other members of Earthjustice in calling for you to suspend the use of sulfoxaflor on all crops pending a thorough analysis of the impacts to bees and the many crops that depend on bees for pollination.","Sulfoxaflor  – Pesticide Petition (PP# 4F8237) and Registration Requests for use on Corn, Sorghum, Pineapple, Alfalfa, Clover, and Cacao"

LETTER FROM MEMBERS: 


Dear Dr. Frost, 

I am writing in support of the National Park Services (NPS) proposed rule concerning hunting and trapping in national preserves in Alaska (RIN 1024-AE21; Fed. Reg. Doc. No. 2014-20881; NPS-2014-0004-0001). 

By prohibiting the artificial manipulation of predator-prey dynamics, as well as unsporting and inhumane practices such as denning, baiting and hounding, NPS will take an important step toward maintaining the ecological integrity of national preserves across Alaska. 

In particular, I strongly encourage the Service to implement and enforce proposed prohibitions against:
	Killing predators to artificially boost game populations, which is both inhumane and ecologically destructive; 
	Spotlighting to take black bear cubs and sows at den sites, when they are particularly vulnerable;
	Baiting brown and black bears, which is known to lead to habituation to human food and corresponding conflicts; 
	Taking wolves and coyotes during the denning season, when their pelts have little value and there is an enhanced risk of orphaning pups; and
	Using dogs to hunt black bears, which can cause prolonged suffering to the bears, as well as serious injuries to the dogs. 

Each of these practices disrupts ecosystems, threatens target and non-target animals with inhumane capture and killing, and runs counter to traditional fair chase principles. It is NPSs responsibility to manage national preserves for the benefit of all Americans, and implementing the proposed rule will advance that important mission. 

Sincerely,

Each year, $330 million of natural gas is wasted on our public lands through the harmful practices of venting and flaring. Fortunately, the BLM made great strides towards curbing this waste and reducing the burden on both taxpayers and the environment, by finalizing the Methane and Waste Prevention Rule last year. The BLM rule takes a cost-effective and common sense approach to reining in methane waste and modernizing how energy is developed and used across our landscapes.

Without the BLM methane waste rule, the oil and gas industry would be free to recklessly leak millions of tons of methane pollution and toxic chemicals into the air without limits, harming our health and accelerating climate change. Furthermore, children who suffer from asthma are threatened by toxic air pollution that is released alongside natural gas waste, and if DOI delays or completely repeals the rule, that will harm children's health.

Strong protections on methane and toxic pollution from oil and gas production are a win-win, keeping us safer and providing needed revenue that benefits our local schools and infrastructure like roads and bridges. Suspending the BLM methane waste rule means the waste of more American energy and is unacceptable.

We need to keep environmental protections intact that help protect our lands and water from overuse and pollution. These regulations are important first steps to help protect health and safety of public lands and nearby communities. Delaying on environmental regulations is a dangerous step backward from guidelines that would help end wasteful natural gas leaks and dangerous flares.

Every year, the oil and gas industry leaks millions of tons of methane pollution. Methane is extremely potent -- about 30 times more potent than CO2 -- and it's a huge contributor to climate change. That's why the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management stepped in and issued the methane emissions rule last year.

Ban chlorpyrifos now (RE: EPA-HQ-OPP-2015-0653-0402)

Dear Environmental Protection Agency:

I urge the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to ban all uses of the neurotoxic pesticide chlorpyrifos immediately. Whenever this chemical is sprayed in the air, it can cause both immediate and long-term health harms to farmworkers, kids and others who are exposed. Every year, chlorpyrifos spraying in agricultural fields poisons farmworkers and other people exposed to pesticide drift in the air. This chemical is also linked to reduced IQ and attention deficit disorders in children. Just last year the EPA released an updated assessment of chlorpyrifos and concluded that current safety standards are not enough to protect public health. 

The EPA should take immediate steps to ban this brain-damaging pesticide to: 

	Protect children from learning and memory impairments
	Protect communities from poisoning when the pesticides drift off crops and into nearby neighborhoods and schools
	Prevent contamination of our food 
	Prevent contamination of our drinking water
	Prevent worker poisonings and harm to their children

Action on this toxic chemical is long overdue. I urge you to ensure that your agency moves quickly to ban chlorpyrifos now.

Subject: Ban all use of the toxic pesticide chlorpyrifos

Dear Administrator McCarthy: EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy,

EPA's recent proposal to ban use of the neurotoxic pesticide
chlorpyrifos on food crops was a big step in the right direction. I
urge you now to follow through with this proposal -- and to do even
more to protect our health by banning all uses of this dangerous,
outdated chemical.

After years of delay, EPA has finally acknowledged the extensive
evidence that exposure to chlorpyrifos damages the development of
children's brains. Immediate action to ban chlorpyrifos is needed to:

* Protect children from reduced IQ, developmental delay, and other
harms to the brain and nervous system;
* Protect communities from health harms of chlorpyrifos when it drifts
off crops and into nearby neighborhoods and schools;
* Protect infants from contaminated drinking water and other unsafe
exposures; and
* Protect workers from being poisoned at unconscionable rates

A complete ban on this toxic chemical is long overdue. I urge you to
ensure that your agency moves quickly to ban chlorpyrifos now.

Thank you for your consideration of this important issue.

Protect ALL communities from the toxic risks of chlorpyrifos (RE: Docket ID # EPA-HQ-OPP-2015-0653-0001)

Dear Administrator McCarthy,

I urge the EPA to ban all uses of the neurotoxic insecticide chlorpyrifos, based on extensive evidence that it causes neurodevelopmental harm to children and poisons workers and their families when it's sprayed in the fields. The EPA banned household uses of chlorpyrifos in 2000 and now has proposed a ban for use on food crops. That doesn't go far enough: All workers and communities deserve protection.

After years of delay, the EPA has finally acknowledged the extensive evidence that exposure to chlorpyrifos damages the development of children's brains. It's time to act to protect children from reduced IQ, delayed development and attention disorders associated with this dangerous pesticide. 

Despite acknowledging the brain impairments to children at low levels of exposure, the EPA is considering allowing continued use of this pesticide on some crops and in nurseries, based on scientifically flawed studies conducted by Dow Agrosciences, the company that manufactures chlorpyrifos.

The EPA should take immediate steps to ban all uses of chlorpyrifos in order to:

* Protect children from learning and memory impairments
* Protect communities from pesticide poisonings when chlorpyrifos drifts off crops and into nearby neighborhoods and schools
* Prevent contamination of drinking water with chlorpyrifos
* Prevent worker poisonings

Dear Administrator McCarthy,

We urge you to reject the request from Syngenta Crop Protection for increased tolerance levels of thiamethoxam, a neonicotinoid pesticide known to harm bees and other pollinators.

Increased tolerance levels on the requested crops  including corn, soybeans, wheat, and alfalfa  would pave the way for foliar spray, resulting in drift to neighboring crops and flowering plants where bees forage. It will also increase surface water contamination.

The crops named in Syngentas request account for more than 250 million acres of land, much of it in the Midwest where pollinator populations are already particularly vulnerable.

Across the country, bees are dying off at unprecedented rates. Instead of allowing more bee-toxic pesticides in the field, we urge you to take immediate action to protect bees from neonicotinoids already in widespread use.


Sincerely,

Food is more important than profit -- suspend neonics! (EPA Docket  EPA-HQ-OPP-2014-0008-0005)

U.S. beekeepers lost an average of 45 percent of their colonies between the end of 2012 and the end of 2013 -- and thanks to pesticides called neonicotinoids, hives are producing 85 percent fewer queens. 

Neonicotinoids aren't just terrifying for the beekeepers or our agricultural economy -- they're terrifying for my family. This enormous threat to our food supply is why I request that the EPA deny Syngenta's request to expand and increase the use of thiamethoxam, and instead immediately suspend all registration of neonicotinoids.

The massive decline in the bee population threatens the very survival of the fruits and vegetables grown on our soil. In the past several months, at least five separate studies have added substantial weight to the growing body of evidence showing that widespread use of neonicotinoids -- like thiamethoxam -- is linked to this Colony Collapse Disorder. Our food supply is more important than expanding corporate profits, so Americans need you to deny Syngenta's request and suspend neonic registration now!","Thiamethoxam: Amended Tolerances"

This message has been signed by 13,788 people in the Ocean Conservancy community. There names as well as cities and states of residence are attached to this message.

The offshore Arctic Ocean is home to an amazing array of wildlife, including walruses, polar bears, ice-dependent seals, and bowhead and beluga whales. It is also a remote and challenging environment, which makes offshore oil and gas operations in Arctic waters especially risky. When there is a major spill in the Arctic Ocean, clean-up will be all be impossible, and the damage could be catastrophic.
 
The Department of the Interior should not allow oil companies to drill in the Arctic at this time. But if drilling does go forward, it is essential that oil and gas operators are held to the highest possible standards for safety and oil spill prevention and response. The Department of the Interior's proposed Arctic standards are an important first step. These proposed rules include critical requirements for oil spill prevention and control that should not be weakened, including:
 
+ A capping stack and containment system must be located nearby to quickly capture oil spilling from an out-of-control well;
+ A second rig must be located in the region and available to respond to an out-of-control well before ice moves in; and
+ Drilling and oil spill response plans must take into account Arctic conditions such as ice, dangerous sea states, and dense fog.
 
In addition, the Department of the Interior should strengthen the proposed rules to allow the public to review and comment on oil companies' proposed spill response plans. These plans are an important window on a company's preparedness for operating in a dangerous and unique environment, and they deserve public scrutiny.
 
If oil companies want to operate in Arctic waters, they should be required to meet the strongest standards possible for safety, oil spill prevention, and response. I support the improvements proposed in the Arctic standards, and I urge you to strengthen the rules even more by providing for public review and comment on oil spill response plans.

Sincerely,","Requirements for Exploratory Drilling on the Arctic OCS"

RE: Please strengthen rules to protect the Mexican Gray Wolf  (RE: Docket No. FWS-R2-ES-2013-0056)

Dear U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,

I am writing to urge you to protect the Mexican gray wolf.

Wolves are a keystone species--their presence is critical to maintaining the structure and integrity of our native ecosystems. 

The Mexican gray wolf subspecies is genetically distinct from other wolves, and is one of the most endangered mammals in North America.

Before finalizing regulations to protect wild Mexican gray wolves, please address the following flaws of your recent proposal:

* Putting a population cap on wolves that is not scientifically based
* Failing to adequately address illegal wolf killings
* Excessively restricting where wolves can roam
* Allowing members of the general public to kill wolves with a permit, which could easily result in the deaths of the individuals most critical to the survival of this already struggling species

For years, these wolves have struggled to survive in the wild. We need regulations to protect them that are scientifically based.

Thank you for your consideration,

Though all represent the individual views of the submitters, please note there are over 90 distinct messages.

Oregon is currently home to only three known wolverines in the state. However, given the effort required to confirm those three and anecdotal evidence there are likely others. The state is home to a considerable amount of suitable habitat. However the species and their habitat face severe threats that are both direct and indirect including climate change, development, habitat fragmentation, mismanagement of habitat, inadequate regulations, trapping, some public hostility towards wildlife, and the effects from small isolated populations.

Given the small number of wolverines in Oregon and the lower-48 United States and the threats they face, wolverines are deserving of the full protections of the Endangered Species Act. They require significant critical habitat designations and a complete recovery plan to recover in Oregon and neighboring states. 

Recent trapping in Oregon and the state’s response coupled with a lack of a management plan and weak trapping regulations demonstrated how woefully unprepared Oregon is to manage and recover wolverines without the full protections of the federal Endangered Species Act.

We urge you to give wolverines the full protections of the Endangered Species Act, designate critical habitat in Oregon and elsewhere, and complete a recovery plan that will allow them to recover where they already exist and disperse to and thrive where good habitat remains.

I write to urge you to protect the Bureau of Land Management's safeguards for hydraulic fracturing (fracking) on public lands. Fracking is a dangerous practice that can contaminate our air and water, while contributing to the release of greenhouse gases. There is no amount of regulation that can make fracking safe, but rescinding or weaken the recently updated rules only puts our shared resources at greater risk. 

The updated fracking rules are long overdue and simply lay out basic standards for states to follow. They were enacted after years of review and process and should not be weakened or repealed. Please do not put our federal lands at risk by repealing our first line of defense against groundwater contamination.

On behalf of Environmental Action, an education and advocacy organization dedicated to the conservation of America's treasures, I formally submit more than 16,000 signatures in strong opposition to rescinding Bureau of Land Management's 2015 final rule ""Oil and Gas, Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands.

We need to keep environmental protections intact that help protect public lands and water from overuse and pollution. These regulations are important first steps to help protect health and safety of public lands and nearby communities. Removing environmental regulations is a dangerous step backward.

Please don't let our federal lands be put at risk by weakening or repealing our first line of defense against groundwater contamination

""I write to urge you to protect the Bureau of Land Management's protections from hydraulic fracturing on public lands.
The best way to protect our air, water and communities is to prohibit this harmful form of fossil fuel extraction. America's public lands, rightfully known as national treasures, are at risk from fracking for oil and gas.

There is no amount of regulation that can make fracking safe, but rescinding or weaken the recently updated rules only puts our shared resources and nearby communities at greater risk to drilling accidents, leaks and spills that pollute air and contaminate drinking water.

The updated fracking rules are long overdue after years of review and process. They simply lay out basic standards for states to follow. Please do not put our federal lands at risk by weakening or repealing our first line of defense against groundwater contamination.""

Re: Proposed rescission of Bureau of Land Management Hydraulic Fracturing Rule, 82 Fed. Reg. 34464 (July 25, 2017)
Dear Secretary Zinke,

Please do not rescind the Bureau of Land Management's 2015 rule addressing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule is the product of nearly five years of agency work, expert input, public comments and hearings, and it provides much-needed updates to the Bureau's existing regulations, which were last overhauled in the 1980s. The 2015 rule requires companies to store fracturing wastes in tanks rather than pits, and for the first time will require prior review and approval of fracturing operations on public and tribal lands. The rule also modernizes the agency's well construction and testing standards and mandates disclosure of the chemicals that companies use in fracking fluid. All of these are reasonable, cost-effective measures that will better protect our public lands, drinking water, wildlife and public health and safety. They should not be abandoned.

Thank you for your consideration of these comments.

Re: Docket No. CFPB-2016-0020 or RIN 3170-AA51

The undersigned consumer, civil rights, labor, community, and non-profit organizations strongly support the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)'s proposed rule to limit pre-dispute binding mandatory (or forced) arbitration clauses in consumer finance contracts. The CFPB rule, which will restore consumers' ability to band together in court to pursue claims, is a significant step forward in the ongoing fight to curb predatory practices in consumer financial products and services and to make these markets fairer and safer.  

Lenders and other financial services companies use forced arbitration to push consumers out of court and into a private arbitration system that is tilted against them. Forced arbitration eliminates the right to a civil jury trial, limits discovery, restricts or prohibits public disclosure of proceedings and outcomes, and makes meaningful appeals virtually impossible. It also often prohibits consumers from banding together in a class action to hold the company responsible. 

The CFPB's thorough arbitration study  clearly documents how forced arbitration blocks consumer access to courts, shielding banks and lenders from meaningful accountability for their unlawful behavior. Finalizing the proposed rule will restore crucial class action rights that deter systemic abuses and bring much-needed transparency to consumer financial arbitration...

Dear Ms. Jackson:

The attached comments are submitted by Courage Campaign on behalf of our members regarding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (""CFPB"") proposed rules to restrict the use of forced arbitration clauses in consumer financial contracts and restore consumers' ability to band together in class actions.

We are submitting 28,003 comments from individuals around the country urging the Bureau to strengthen the proposals in its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Docket ID CFPB-2016- 0020). Specifically, we call on the Bureau to use its full authority to restore consumers' right to choose how to resolve disputes with financial institutions in the final rule. 

The petition language signed onto by these individuals is as follows:

To: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 

Consumers already face a stacked deck when they try to hold large corporations accountable for harms - but forced arbitration clauses in consumer financial contracts make it nearly impossible to beat the odds. I support the CFPB's proposed rule to restore consumers' right to join together and take companies to court when they break the law.

Barring consumers from joining class actions directly opposes the public interest. I urge the CFPB to act on its congressional mandate by restricting the abusive practice of forced arbitration in the final rule.

Some signers chose to make additional comments, which are present in column F of the attached spreadsheet. 

If you require any additional information, please let us know.

Sincerely,

It's been over a year since President Obama introduced the executive order (#13650) to improve chemical safety and security, which directs federal agencies to modernize chemical plant safety and security policies. I'm concerned that since the disaster in West, Texas that took the lives of fifteen people and injured over 200, very little has been done to modernize policies to require facilities to adopt inherently safer systems.
				
The Agency must use its authority under the 1990 Clean Air Act to prevent a future chemical disaster as soon as possible. Common sense solutions exist and the best way to prevent a future disaster is to require chemical facilities to use safer chemical processes. The only way to ensure they are used is to activate the Clean Air Act's ""Bhopal"" provision in sections 112 (r)(1) and 112 (r)(7)(A). By activating this authority the EPA can require chemical facilities to use the safest cost-effective chemical process available to eliminate the potential for catastrophic chemical releases.
			
We've seen the news headlines from West, Texas; Charleston, West Virginia; Richmond, California and these disasters illustrate the need for new safety requirements that will truly prevent tragedies. The EPA's current timeline for a decision on new safety rules is scheduled for 2016 and that could be too late for those who live in the shadow of dangerous facilities.
				
The EPA must finalize regulations before President Obama leaves office.
				
Enforceable disaster prevention requirements are long overdue and should be prioritized immediately because hazards are unacceptable and the threat to people's lives are preventable.
			
Actions the Agency should take under the ""Bhopal"" amendment to the 1990 Clean Air Act include:
					
- Make prevention a requirement that chemical facilities use safer chemicals or processes wherever feasible.

- Prioritize protection of the most vulnerable populations, including workers, nearby communities and first responders.

- Require chemical facilities to reduce the use of the most toxic substances where alternatives are available.

Citizens and scientists alike are asking the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to act now and modernize chemical plant safety and security policies. When the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists informed supporters of the opportunity to comment on the EPAs Request for Information on potential revisions to the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations and related programs, 16,494 people responded enthusiastically with comments. 

In the attached documents, you will find each of these comments from concerned citizens who want the EPA to use its authority to act and especially consider the following three standards while it reviews the RMP: 

* The EPA must require the use of safer chemical processes wherever
possible to reduce risk to the public and workers. In the absence of
regulation requiring this, many companies lack the incentive to switch
to safer alternatives, even though they exist.

* The EPA must improve access to scientific information, especially
during emergency situations. Lack of information can be detrimental to
the environment and human health, as recently demonstrated by the
chemical spill in West Virginia's Elk River in January 2014.

* The EPA must require better chemical disclosure. Currently, chemical
facilities can abdicate responsibility for emergency response
preparedness to local authorities without providing them with all the
information and capacity they need. This is unacceptable and needs to
be fixed immediately.

It has been more than a year since President Obama signed an executive order directing federal agencies to modernize chemical plant safety and security policies. With limited federal action to date, the need for improvement remains evident, as illustrated by the recent disasters in Charleston, West Virginia; West, Texas; and Richmond, California. 

Disaster prevention, transparency, disclosure, and access to information must be central to any revisions of the RMP. As echoed by the 16,494 comments here, the EPA must take appropriate steps to protect communities from risks posed by chemical facilities and ensure that the Agency can respond effectively when accidents occur.

RE: Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs Under the Clean Air Act - Request for Information and Comments (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OEM-2014-0328)

Dear Environmental Protection Agency,

The EPA has taken an important step by requesting information on how to improve chemical safety oversight. Now the agency must use its full legal authority and commonsense measures to protect workers and communities from chemical disasters.

Over a year ago, President Obama introduced Executive Order #13650, directing federal agencies to modernize chemical plant safety and security policies. In 2013, an explosion in West, TX , took the lives of 15 people--including firefighters--and injured more than 200. In 2012, the Chevron oil refinery exploded in Richmond, CA, causing more than 15,000 people to seek medical treatment. Despite these disasters and many other close calls, very little has been done to modernize policies to require facilities to adopt inherently safer systems.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must immediately use its authority under the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act to prevent future chemical disasters. Any common sense strategy for reducing chemical disasters should include an EPA requirement that chemical facilities use safer processes. Voluntary guidelines are not getting the job done to protect workers and communities. That is why the EPA must activate authority under the Clean Air Act's ""Bhopal"" provisions in sections 112 (r)(1) and 112 (r)(7)(A) to require chemical facilities to use the safest cost-effective chemical process available to eliminate the potential for catastrophic chemical releases.

A recent report by the Environmental Justice and Health Alliance (EJHA) for Chemical Policy Reform (cosponsored by Coming Clean and the Center for Effective Government) highlighted that more than 134 million Americans live in the danger zones around the 3,433 facilities that store or use highly hazardous chemicals. Most in danger are the 3.8 million people living at the fence line of these facilities. How many more news headlines and preventable suffering must our country endure before the EPA uses its power to hold chemical facilities accountable for safe operations? The threat burden posed by chemical disasters is more acutely felt by residents of communities of color and those with limited economic and political influence. Specifically, the EJHA report found that Blacks RE: Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OEM-2014-0328 are 75 percent more likely than the greater U.S. population as a whole to live in fenceline zones near chemical facilities. Latinos are 60 percent more likely to live in fenceline communities. The current EPA timeline for updating chemical safety standards asks the public to wait until 2016, when there are steps that can be taken immediately to prevent chemical disasters. Vulnerable communities and workers cannot afford to wait for a safer industrial neighbor.

We also call on the Obama EPA to adopt standards during this administration to enforce disaster prevention standards under the ""Bhopal"" amendment to the 1990 Clean Air Act, including:
* Requiring chemical facilities to use safer chemicals or processes wherever feasible
* Prioritizing protection of the most vulnerable populations, including workers, nearby communities, and first responders
* Requiring chemical facilities to reduce the use of the most toxic substances where alternatives are available
* Requiring the use of backup power and the adoption of inherently safer systems before these emergencies occur
* Phasing out the use of hydrogen fluoride
* Providing for anonymous worker reporting of safety and maintenance issues
* Providing support for those impacted by the inaction of the EPA and industrial bad actors for a just and safe relocation. This is not a first resort.

There is no better time than the present to address the safety threat that refineries and other chemical facilities pose to both workers and communities.

The 8,067 members and supporters of Public Citizen whose names are gathered in the attached petition signed onto the following statement regarding EPA-HQ-OEM-2014-0328:

I am deeply concerned about the safety of hazardous chemical facilities in this country.

More than 110 million people live in high-risk zones near these facilities, but basic safety standards are not required in the manufacturing and storing of dangerous chemicals. We should not risk more tragedies at facilities that store flammable chemicals, like the fertilizer plant in West, Texas that exploded in 2013.

I urge you to act swiftly to implement the disaster prevention requirements included in executive order #13650 which directs federal agencies modernize chemical plant safety policies. Safer processing methods, reduced use of the most toxic substances and commonsense safety measures should be a requirement for all hazardous chemical facilities.

We need to take this stand now. The next administration will not care about the Rusty-Patched Bumblebees, other pollinators, or the environment. Make history today by adding this humble but vital bee to the Endangered Species List.

RE: Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Mexican Wolf Draft Recovery Plan, First Revision (FWS-R2-ES-2017-0036-0001)

Dear Fish and Wildlife Service,

Thank you for releasing a draft recovery plan for the Mexican gray wolf, an iconic species of the American Southwest.  Unfortunately, scientific shortcomings in the draft plan will prevent the lobo's recovery.  I urge you to revise the recovery plan so that it is based on the best available science.

Specifically, I urge you to fix the following flaws:

	The draft recovery plan calls for too few wolves over too small an area.  The peer-reviewed, best available science says that additional Mexican wolf populations must be established in the United Statesspecifically in the Grand Canyon and southern Rockiesfor the species to survive.  Mexican wolves should number at least 700 in the United Statesnot the 320-380 FWS calls for in the draft plan.
	The draft recovery plan relies too heavily on recovery in Mexicodespite the fact that habitat there is inadequate. Further, prey numbers used in FWS's modeling exercises are unreliable and likely biased high.
	The draft recovery plan does not sufficiently address the genetic threats facing the Mexican wolf.  For example, FWS allows for continued erosion of the genetic diversity of the captive Mexican gray wolf populationdespite the fact that the genetic diversity of the captive population has already substantially deteriorated and retains only 83% of the founders' genetic diversity.  In addition, the draft plan states that natural reproduction, rather than releases of captive wolves, will drive growth of the wild Mexican wolf populations.  This will prevent necessary infusion of new genes into the wild populations and lead to further inbreeding problems.
	FWS hands control of releases of captive wolves over to the states of Arizona and New Mexico.  This is problematic when the states have been actively hostile to Mexican wolf recovery, with New Mexico even filing a lawsuit to prevent such releases.

For years, Mexican gray wolves have struggled to survive in the wild.  With this recovery plan, FWS is charting the course for the future of this species: will it once again flourish on the Southwestern landscape, or will it go extinct?  The current recovery plan overlooks the best available science and threatens the future of the Mexican wolf.  Please address the shortcomings identified in this letter and craft a science-based recovery plan that will prevent extinction of this magnificent and critically endangered species.

Petition Text:

Thank you for proposing the long-awaited Stream Protection Rule to protect our waterways and communities from hazardous coal mining pollution. I urge you to stand up to the Big Polluters who have been allowed to poison our waters and families for too long by quickly finalizing a strong rule. 

The draft Stream Protection Rule includes some very important steps forward, including enhanced water quality monitoring and stream restoration requirements. However, the rule needs to be stronger, ensuring that citizens will still be able to enforce water quality standards and hold polluters accountable in the courts for damage they cause. In addition, reinstating the 100 foot ""buffer zone"" would help prevent streams from being destroyed in the first place and reduce the need for restoration.

For too long, coal mining pollution has jeopardized the health and environment of mining communities. Please finalize a strong Stream Protection Rule soon to ensure a cleaner, healthier future for all our communities.

Strengthen the Stream Protection Rule (RE: Docket ID # OSM-2010-0018-0001)

Dear Secretary Jewell, Director Pizarchik, and Administrator McCarthy,

Mountaintop removal coal mining is a national disgrace. It has already flattened 500 mountains, obliterated 2000 miles of streams, and erased 2.5 million acres of Appalachia's ancient forests. This destruction won't stop unless you act.

To make sure your Stream Protection Rule actually protects community water sources from the extreme and irreversible damage of mountaintop removal mining, you need to strengthen the proposed rule. Most important, you need to make clear that mining operations will never be allowed to violate water quality standards, and you must ensure that citizens can enforce water quality standards when state regulators fail. You also need to restore the ban on harmful mining activities within 100 feet of streams. Your legacy should be ending the destruction of waters by mountaintop removal mining, not a weakening of existing protections. 

I stand with all the people of Appalachia whose health, culture and access to clean water are threatened by mountaintop removal mining. I hope the Obama administration will stand with us, too, by strengthening this rule before it is finalized.

RE: National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan EPA-HQ-OPA-2006-0090-0010

Dear Environmental Protection Agency,

Twenty-six years after the Exxon Valdez grounded in Prince William Sound and five years after the Deepwater Horizon blowout in the Gulf of Mexico, it's high time for the EPA to finalize a strong rule to ensure that responses to oil spills are not more hazardous to public health and the environment than the release of oil itself. In both Alaska and the Gulf, too little was known about chemical dispersants that were released in unprecedented volumes to disperse oil. We now know that these chemicals don't get rid of the oil--and that the effects of oil mixed with dispersants can be more harmful than oil alone.

We need a strong rule to make sure we sufficiently test and understand the effectiveness and toxicity of the chemicals used in response to oil spills, and the EPA should never again allow the use of dispersants that add to the toxic brew in our nation's waters. In addition, information about the chemicals in dispersants--including the chemical ingredients and health and safety information--shouldn't be secret. The public, including workers exposed to dispersants, fisherman who rely on clean waters for their livelihood, and nearby residents, have the right to know what they're being exposed to.

The long-overdue rule must ensure protection of public health and the environment so our coastal communities don't face the threat of another chaotic and uninformed response when the next oil disaster hits. Please finalize a strong rule before dispersants are used again without adequate protection or information.

Ban Gunman's Accessories That Enabled Vegas Killing Spree
This summer, a gunman killed 58 people and injured 546 more in an instant in Las Vegas. Using an accessory called a bump stock, the gunman was able to turn his semi-automatic weapon into one that was nearly automatic, giving him the ability to turn a concert into a massacre in mere seconds. Automatic weapons are tightly regulated in the U.S., but bump stocks, the tool that lets semi-automatic weapons become nearly automatic, are not. Its a loophole. And so far, Congress hasnt done anything about it.

Instead of implementing comprehensive legislative changes that would take bump stocks off the national market immediately, Congress is letting the process drag out for years in a federal rulemaking process. We cant wait that long. Cities like Columbia, South Carolina and states like New Jersey, led by Gov. Chris Christie, have already banned bump stocks in the months since the Las Vegas massacre. But a patchwork of city and state laws isnt enough. We need to ban bump stocks nationwide, now, so tragedies like Las Vegas can never happen again. Tell Congress and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms: If Columbia, South Carolina can do it, so can the countrywe need more than a patchwork of local and state laws, we need a national ban on bump stocks.","ANPRM on ""Bumpfire"" Stocks and Other Similar Devices.

Comment: To fully protect American communities from another mass shooting on the devastating scale of Las Vegas, Congress must act to ban bump stocks and other similar firearm devices or accessories designed to dramatically accelerate the rate of gunfire. In the absence of congressional action, ATF should issue a new rule clarifying that the definition of ""machine gun"" in the National Firearms Act of 1934 includes conversion devices like bump fire stocks that convert a semi-automatic rifle into the functional equivalent of a fully automatic rifle. These devices are intended to circumvent the restrictions on possession of fully automatic firearms, and both Congress and ATF must take action quickly to address this threat to public safety.

These comments have been attached.

Users were able to customize their public comment, and several of these are attached in a separate document. Below is the standard, unedited comment. Thank you for considering these points.

Default Comment:

I strongly oppose NOAA Fisheries' proposal to potentially open nearly 5,000 square miles of protected New England waters to commercial fishing. These areas have been protecting habitat and contributing to the recovery of fish and other wildlife for nearly two decades. With several groundfish species still severely depleted, now is not the time to eliminate protections and risk pushing these groundfish beyond their ability to recover. 

Recent scientific assessments indicate that many of New England's groundfish populations are at precariously low levels and half are being fished at unsustainable rates. For example, Gulf of Maine cod is at approximately 16 percent of what is considered a healthy population, while Georges Bank cod is at just 7 percent. Removing protections for juvenile and spawning fish will result in even greater damage to these populations, their habitat, and the fishing communities that depend on them. 

These proposed changes to protected areas represent a fundamental change in the way marine resources are managed for the public good and will have significant impacts to the region's ocean habitat. I urge NOAA Fisheries to complete a full analysis of the potential biological and economic impacts prior to reopening any currently protected areas to additional fishing. In short, an environmental impact statement is needed.","Framework Adjustment 48 to the Northeast Multispecies FMP"

Re: Requests for Information: Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Outside Sales and Computer Employees (RIN:1235-AA20)

Dear Ms. Smith:

Attached please find 66,957 signatures collected online by CREDO Action in regard to the overtime pay rule.

Individual comments may differ throughout, although the majority read as follows: 

""I urge the Department of Labor to implement the new overtime rule, keep the salary threshold at at least $47,476 and continue indexing the threshold to inflation. Under President Gerald Ford, the overtime exemption was $58,000 in today's dollars, covering more than 50 percent of full-time salaried workers. Cutting or weakening this rule in any form would be an attack on the 12.5 million people whose hard work will now be rewarded with more take-home pay.""

Please contact me if you have any questions about the attached submission.

Sincerely, 

Murshed Zaheed,

These 14,763 commenters have stated that they care deeply for our natural world, and are writing to express their strong opposition to the proposed revisions to the Well Control Rule. Weakening this lifesaving necessary rule increases our risk of catastrophic oil spills that threaten human life and wildlife alike. As we witnessed with Deepwater Horizon, the increased risks of the loss of human life and devastating impacts to our marine wildlife, oceans and coasts are not worth weakening this rule.

The American people strongly oppose weakening key parts of a rule that were put in place to protect the marine environment, marine wildlife and people whose livelihoods depend on fishing and coastal tourism as well as those working in the offshore drilling industry. 

Several federal government investigative bodies that examined the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe recommended these detailed technical upgrades to enhance safety and environmental protection. President Trump issued Executive Order 13795 on April 28, 2017 instructing the Department of the Interior to reconsider these rules to promote energy exploration and production. The oil industry strongly supported weakening these rules. 

The upgraded rules have been working. In fiscal year 2017, there were zero blowouts, down from several blowouts in previous years.

Key parts of the rule that would be weakened by Interior include: real-time monitoring of drilling operations offshore and onshore, a standardized safe drilling margin (i.e., the amount of drilling muds needed to prevent upward pressure that results in blowouts), and several important procedures for equipment failure investigations and reporting.  

Americans want clean, safe coasts and oceans and want their coastal regions to be free from oil and other toxins so they can enjoy marine wildlife and can fish and recreate safely.

Each of the 14,763 commenters listed in the attached document strongly oppose this irresponsible rollback of safety standards for offshore drilling and urge you to keep these vital regulations in place.

The American public has the right to peacefully demonstrate at the White House and National Mall, and these proposed regulations will curb our ability to exercise our First Amendment rights.

Attn: Brian Joyner

Attached please find 19,499 comments collected online by CREDO Action in regards to regulations governing the management of permitted demonstrations and special events on the National Mall and Memorial Parks (RIN 1024-AE45).

Individual comments may differ throughout, although the majority read as follows: 

""I am writing to express my opposition to the National Park Service's proposed regulations that will negatively affect the rights of the people to demonstrate in the nation's capital. These regulations would impede the ability of people to assemble and to speak out on matters of importance, which is crucial to participatory democracy.

I oppose any effort by the government to charge demonstrators for engaging in First Amendment activities. Demonstrations, including musical performances or other elements that are part of them, are different than special events that are commercial or corporate sponsored and should remain fully distinct in their treatment.

The White House sidewalk should not be restricted or closed to protest assemblies. From Suffragists, to anti-lynching pickets, to anti-war demonstrations, to calls to save our environment, this is a critical and iconic location for the expression of views to the government, to the press and to the world.

I also oppose other restrictions and burdens on protests in the proposed regulations including the proposal to eliminate the rule, ordered previously by the courts, that permit applicants know within 24 hours whether their permit is granted or denied so that they can immediately begin organizing and let people know about a demonstration and make plans to come. This is important to my ability to participate in free speech activities in Washington, D.C.""

Please find comments from 1001 parents attached, asking for immediate implementation of the menu labeling guidelines that were scheduled to take effect in May 2017. (Document is Part 8 of 8)

Guessing games are fun, but not when it comes to knowing what's in the food we give our kids. Menu labeling helps parents and kids make informed choices about what they eat and drink.

Eighty percent of Americans support menu labeling in chain restaurants, and 81% support having restaurants provide information about prepared foods. [1] Families eat out almost twice as often as they did in the 1970s, and kids consume about 1/4 of their daily calories at fast-food and other restaurants. [4] And let's be real: many of the options on the menu aren't healthy. At one popular establishment, a side order of corn bread has over TWICE the calories as a side order of fries. [1]

Menu labeling works! New York City has already implemented menu labeling, and 82% of consumers reported that it has had an impact on what they've ordered. [3]

Labeling will make a big difference when it comes to the health of our families, too. Studies show that providing nutrition information at restaurants can help people make lower calorie choices, and encourage restaurants to introduce lower-calorie items or change recipes to cut calories on current items. [5] It just makes sense all around.

Any delays to implementing menu labeling as proposed is bad news for families.

Menu labeling gives parents the information they need to make healthy choices for their families. Eating out shouldn't be a guessing game.

[1] Families eat out almost twice as often as they did in the 1970s, and kids consume about 1/4 of their daily calories at fast-food and other restaurants. [4] And let's be real: many of the options on the menu aren't healthy. At one popular establishment, a side order of corn bread has over TWICE the calories as a side order of fries. [1]

Menu labeling works! New York City has already implemented menu labeling, and 82% of consumers reported that it has had an impact on what they've ordered. [3]

Labeling will make a big difference when it comes to the health of our families, too. Studies show that providing nutrition information at restaurants can help people make lower calorie choices, and encourage restaurants to introduce lower-calorie items or change recipes to cut calories on current items. [5] It just makes sense all around.

Any delays to implementing menu labeling as proposed is bad news for families.

Menu labeling gives parents the information they need to make healthy choices for their families. Eating out shouldn't be a guessing game.

Thank You for Cutting Cement Kilns' Mercury

Dear Administrator Jackson,

We, the undersigned, applaud you for taking the first significant step towards 
cleaning up mercury, hydrochloric acid, particulate matter and other toxic air 
pollution from our nation's cement kilns.

This is an important decision that will affect the lives of millions of Americans who 
are forced to breathe the toxic pollution that cement kilns emit. Controlling cement 
kilns' mercury emissions will also go a long way toward cleaning up our water 
bodies and making our fish safe to eat again. Eating fish is a healthy part of any 
diet, and it is important that we make sure the fish we eat is free of mercury.

We sincerely hope that you and the EPA will stand strong behind these standards 
which, at long last, bring cement kilns' toxic pollution under control. We also hope 
you will continue the important work of cleaning up toxic air pollution by setting 
strong rules for other sources, such as power plants, chemical refineries and 
incinerators. Thank you for your leadership on this important issue, and keep up 
the good work!

Attached is a document containing the signatures of 33,363 Environmental Defense Fund supporters from across the country who have submitted electronic comments regarding EPA's Regulation of Certain Uses under Toxic Substances Control Act: Trichloroethylene; Vapor Degreasing. The comment they each submitted reads: 

""I'm writing today to strongly urge EPA to finalize its rules to ban high-risk uses of trichloroethylene (TCE), methylene chloride (DCM), and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) under the new Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).  

These chemicals are extremely toxic. TCE is carcinogenic and can cause heart defects in the developing fetus.  DCM is a very lethal chemical  over the past few decades, dozens of workers have died from using DCM-based paint stripping products.  NMP is often used as a substitute for DCM in paint stripping products, yet it also presents major health risks  ranging from developmental and reproductive toxicity to neurotoxicity to liver and kidney damage. 

EPA had not successfully banned a chemical under the original TSCA in nearly three decades.  Now, with its greater authority under the new TSCA as amended by the Lautenberg Act, EPA can score an early public health victory by banning these toxic chemicals for these high-risk uses.  

But the chemical industry is complaining and pressuring EPA to back off, delay, or weaken these much needed rules.  Some in industry are suggesting that measures like putting a simple label on these deadly products or requiring workers to wear protective gear would suffice.  But labels, personal protective equipment, and concentration limits are not enough to protect my family and community.

I strongly urge the Agency to stay on track and promptly ban TCE used as a spot cleaning agent in dry cleaning, as an aerosol spray degreaser in commercial and consumer settings, and as a vapor degreaser in commercial settings, and both DCM and NMP used for commercial and consumer paint stripping. Safer alternatives are already widely available. 

There is simply no excuse to continue putting my family's and my community's health at risk by delaying or weakening these rules.""

Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns about this submission.

"3482",61617,45549,NA,NA,"Comment from Food Democracy Now! (Multiple Comments and Signatures=Over 45,549","On behalf of the family farm and sustainable agriculture organization Food Democracy Now!, I would like to submit the following comments and signatures of more than 45,549 American farmers and citizens to suggest urgent corrections be made to new food safety rules being promulgated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in accordance to the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) of 2010 in order to protect the economic viability of America’s family farmers and local food producers.

I am writing because at Food Democracy Now! we are concerned about the impact that FDA’s proposed FSMA rules will have on the farms that millions of Americans buy food from, the impact it will have on business, and American family’s ability to find local food. I ask you to ensure that new regulations do not put family farms out of business, harm farmers’ soil, water, and wildlife conservation efforts, or shut down the growth of local and regional healthy food systems in the name of false food safety measures.

Growing food and agricultural products is an inherently risky business. There are a lot of steps where things can go wrong. Disease, rot, bacteria and contamination are manageable risks of growing, harvesting, processing, packaging, shipping and handling food. Unfortunately, the massive industrialization of our food supply in the past 40 years has resulted in the growth of previously unimaginable food safety outbreaks that have been massive in scale. The rise of antibiotic resistance in factory farms, E. coli tainted meat and outrageous outbreaks of salmonella in peanut butter and half a billion eggs prove that America’s industrial food supply increases food safety risks and that economies of scale do not necessarily lead to economies of safety.

Rather than focus on these very real problems, the new rules written for the FSMA attempt to place a “one-size-fits-all” approach that will force many small and mid-sized family farmers out of business. As currently written, the new food safety rules being promulgated by the FDA threaten to put more than 30,000 farms out of business; reduce the supply of fresh, local produce in schools and hospitals; push farmers to tear out wildlife habitat and increase the use of chemicals rather than natural fertilizer.

The U.S. needs federal policies that support, not hinder existing and beginning farmers in their continued efforts to grow more fruits and vegetables for local markets.

Currently, local food and agricultural production is one of the fastest growing segments of agriculture and the new FSMA rules unfairly threaten this vibrant industry, which includes 8,144 farmers markets.

It’s common knowledge that different production systems and supply chains pose inherently different risks to the safety of our food supply and the FDA must focus our limited government resources to address the highest risks, those posed by the massive factory farms and industrial food processors.

Regulations must be scale- and supply-chain appropriate to be effective; a one-size fits-all approach will put small and mid-sized farms and processors out of business, undermine public health goals, such as increased production of, availability of, and access to healthy foods, as well as economic opportunity, equity and job-creation goals.

I urge you to modify the rules so that they:

    Allow farmers to use sustainable farming practices, including those already allowed and encouraged by existing federal organic standards and conservation programs. Specifically, FDA must not exceed the strict standards for the use of manure and compost used in certified organic production and regulated by the National Organic Program.

    Ensure that diversified and innovative farms, particularly those pioneering models for increased access to healthy, local foods, continue to grow and thrive without being stifled. Specifically, FDA needs to clarify two key definitions: first, as Congress required, FDA must affirm that farmers markets, CSAs, roadside stands, and other direct-to-consumer vendors fall under the definition of a “retail food establishment” and are therefore not facilities subject to additional regulation. Second, FDA should adopt at least the $1,000,000 threshold for a very small business and base it on the value of ‘regulated product,’ not ‘all food,’ to ensure smaller farms and businesses (like food hubs) fall under the scale-appropriate requirements and aren’t subject to high cost, industrial-scale regulation.

    Provide options that treat family farms fairly, with due process and without excessive costs. Specifically, FDA must clearly define the “material conditions” that lead to a withdrawal of a farmer’s protected status in scientifically measurable terms. FDA must also outline a clear, fair, process for justifying the withdrawal of a farmer’s protected status and for how a farmer can regain that status.

Thank you for your consideration,

Dear BSEE Director Scott Angelle,

On behalf of Environmental Action, an education and advocacy organization dedicated to the conservation of America's treasures, I formally submit more than 18,390 signatures in strong opposition to Oil and Gas Production Safety Systems; Revisions: Oil and Gas and Sulphur Operations on the Outer Continental Shelf (Docket ID: BSEE-2017-0008-0001). 

Offshore drilling is extremely dangerous, and the safety regulations under consideration were created to prevent another disaster like Deepwater Horizon in 2010. Rolling back basic safety regulations is a huge step in the wrong direction. Our ocean waters support diverse marine life. We can't put our coastal communities at risk of catastrophic damage from an oil spill. Oil spills are deadly, and the damage they cause lasts for generations. 

I ask that these signatures (attached) be entered into the official record and considered as individual comments. Each of the people listed in the attached spreadsheet signed this comment:

Offshore drilling is inherently dangerous, and the safety regulations under consideration were created to prevent another disaster like Deepwater Horizon in 2010.

Getting rid of these rules risks another major spill, which puts the animals that live in our oceans at risk -- everything from hypothermia in seals, to damaging the internal organs of sea otters, to causing reproductive harm in orcas.

Do not overhaul these important safety regulations for offshore drilling.

For your convenience, the petition remains available online at: https://environmental-action.webaction.org/p/dia/action4/common/public/?action_KEY=24334

Withdraw your proposed decision to re-register the insecticide sulfoxaflor (Docket ID: EPA-HQ-OPP-2010-0889-0407)

Dear Administrator McCarthy,

I am writing to urge the EPA to withdraw its proposed decision to re-register sulfoxaflor for use on a variety of different crops. 

Bees are facing many challenges, and pesticide exposure is at the top of the list. A mounting body of scientific evidence points to widespread use of systemic insecticides--including sulfoxaflor and similar neonicotinoids--as a key factor in bee declines. 
A meta-analysis of 800 peer-reviewed studies, released by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Task Force on Systemic Pesticides--an international group of independent scientists--is calling for action to restrict the use of systemic insecticides, finding no doubt that they are contributing to colony collapse.

Systemic insecticides like sulfoxaflor can easily kill bees outright, but even at sublethal doses they can impair bees' brain functions and suppress their immune systems--making them more susceptible to diseases, pests and other stressors.

This problem is urgent. Beekeepers report continuing unsustainable losses, and many have gone out of business. This winter we saw a record 44 percent loss in beehives.

I urge the EPA to listen to the growing body of science that tells us we need to restrict this class of pesticides. Neonicotinoids like sulfoxaflor are a key part of the problem and need to be tackled head-on. EPA should not re-register sulfoxaflor in the absence of scientific evidence that there will be no impacts to bees.

Dear EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy

In order to protect bee populations and our nation's food supply, urge the EPA to withdraw its proposed decision to re-register the insecticide ""sulfoxaflor"" for use on a variety of different crops.

Bee populations are declining throughout the country. Increasingly, scientific evidence points to use of insecticides--including sulfoxaflor and other neonicotinoids--as a major factor in colony collapse. This problem becomes more urgent every day.

Beekeepers report unsustainable losses, and many have gone out of business. Last year, for instance, California beekeepers lost nearly 40 percent of their hives, a rate that was twice the national average.

Systemic insecticides like sulfoxaflor can easily kill bees outright, but even at sublethal doses they can impair bees' brain functions and suppress their immune systems--making them more susceptible to diseases, pests and other stressors.

I urge the EPA to listen to the growing body of scientific evidence that we must restrict this class of pesticides. Neonicotinoids like sulfoxaflor pose a major threat to our bees, and to California's agricultural ecosystem and economy. EPA should not re-register sulfoxaflor in the absence of scientific evidence that there will be no impacts to bees.

Because children spend many hours at school, it is critical that
schools adopt policies that support healthy eating and physical
activity. I strongly support the following in the rule:

- All local school wellness policies should address nutrition
guidelines for all foods and beverages available during the school day,
and should only permit marketing of foods and beverages that meet
USDA's ""Smart Snacks"" standards.

- There should be at least one school official who serves as the
designated contact for the wellness policy and who has authority and
responsibility to ensure that each school complies with the policy.

- A diverse team of stakeholders, including parents, school officials,
students, community members, etc., should be involved in developing and
implementing the local wellness policy. In addition, the policy and
assessment of implementation should be made publicly available.

- Regular assessments of the local wellness policy, as well as annual
reports to demonstrate schools' progress toward meeting wellness policy
goals, are essential for ensuring that each school complies with the
policy.

Thank you for proposing these much-needed updates to strengthen
nutrition and physical activity in schools. I urge you to quickly
finalize the rule, and work with schools to ensure full implementation.

"3630",51837,21295,"Sierra Club","Alexander Rony","Submitted Electronically via eRulemaking Portal","Pangolins are the most-trafficked mammal, possibly the most-trafficked animal, on the planet. An estimated 100,000 pangolins are killed every year, an unsustainable number that warrants an ""endangered"" status for each species. Pangolins are clearly threatened by Factors A, B, D, and E as set forth by section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act. Illicit trade and habitat destruction have spread globally and now impact every species of pangolin. Unfortunately, current measures have not been enough to stem the tide of pangolin deaths. 

The attached document includes public comments from 21,295 individuals who are calling on the United States to issue the strongest protections possible for Chinese pangolins under the Endangered Species Act, the Lacey Act, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.","Two Petitions to List the Chinese Pangolin under the Endangered Species Act"

While limiting mosquito populations and the spread of dengue fever and Zika virus is important, this experiment is risky for our environment and public health and is fraught with many unanswered questions. The ""new animal drug"" law is inappropriate for the review of novel risks and impacts of GMO mosquitoes and other new applications of genetic engineering. 

We request that the FDA reject Oxitec's application for genetically engineered mosquitoes and: 
 Complete a full environmental impact statement on Oxitec's GMO mosquito release proposal. 
 Have a committee of independent ecologists and entomologists, public health experts (including dengue fever and Zika virus specialists), and other key experts and public stakeholders review the proposal from Oxitec.
 Convene a public meeting in the Florida Keys, advertised in the Federal Register, for the review of the company's proposal with the above committee present.

Our government agencies must not rely only on data from the companies that would profit from genetically engineered organisms to decide what information the public and regulators should know.

The petition states:

Dear Commissioner Califf,

I urge the Food and Drug Administration to reject Oxitec's application to release genetically engineered mosquitoes in the U.S. (FDA-2014-N-2235).

This experiment is being proposed without the consent of the local community, and potential risks to the environment, public health and Florida's tourism-dependent economy have not been fully assessed. While limiting mosquito populations and the spread of dengue fever is important, this proposal is riddled with too many unanswered questions to proceed. The federal government does not have an appropriate policy to evaluate this new technology. By relying on the animal drug process, the FDA's assessment of possible novel risks from this experimental release is full of holes. I urge the FDA to:

--Complete a full environmental impact statement on Oxitec's  GMO mosquito proposal.

--Convene a committee of independent ecologists and entomologists, public health experts (including dengue fever specialists), and other key experts and stakeholders to review the proposal.

--Convene a public meeting in the community where the field trial is proposed. 

Until the above requests have been met, the application for the field release of genetically engineered mosquitoes must not be allowed to move forward.","Draft Environmental Assessment and Preliminary Finding of No Significant Impact Concerning Investigational Use of Oxitec OX513A Mosquitoes; Availability"

Please list the Distinct Population Segment of fisher under the Endangered Species Act 
(RE: Docket ID FWS-R8-ES-2014-0041)

Dear Fish and Wildlife Service,

I urge you to list the Pacific fisher West Coast population as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.

As you know, fishers have declined dramatically in recent decades due to trapping, logging, and fire. Climate change is amplifying these risks.

Recently, super-toxic rat poisons have shown up as a new threat to fishers. Eighty-five percent of fishers studied from 2012 to 2014 had rodent poisons in their blood. Thirteen fishers were found poisoned to death in California during that time.

U.S. Forest Service researchers have concluded that the southern Sierra fisher population, which is critical to the survival of the entire species, ""may face imminent extinction"" in the absence of increased protection.

The fact is that there are probably fewer than 150 adult female fishers left in the entire Sierra Nevada. If ever an animal was in desperate need of protection, the fisher is it.

Listing the species as threatened will help preserve the habitat needed for the fisher to make a comeback.

Thank you for your consideration,

I am submitting 1807 comment from Clean Water Action members opposed to any attempts by EPA to repeal or weaken the federal coal ash protections adopted in 2015. This is in addition to more than 1700 comments that have submitted directly to the docket. 

For decades too many communities across the country have been exposed to this toxic pollution, and it is unacceptable for your agency to again put them at risk.

EPA must continue to require monitoring of groundwater near coal ash sites, closure of leaking ponds and unstable landfills, clean-up of contaminated sites, public posting of utility monitoring and inspection results, and all of the minimum safeguards required by the 2015 rule. 

EPAs job is to protect public health and the environment, not to give coal utilities a free pass to poison people with their toxic waste. Please withdraw this reckless proposal.

Dear Administrator Leavitt:

EPA is long overdue in controlling toxic air pollution from coal- and 
oil-fired power plants.  In 2003, forty-five states had issued advisories 
to warn against eating mercury-contaminated fish from local waters.  
Mercury and other air toxics from power plants put fetuses and children at 
risk for serious and permanent health impacts.  In healthy adults, mercury 
and other air toxics can adversely affect fertility and blood pressure 
regulation and contribute to heart-rate variability and heart disease.  
Coal-fired power plants are the largest uncontrolled source of mercury, 
acid gases, arsenic, and chromium air pollution; and they are the second 
largest source of lead and dioxin air pollution.

Your agency is promoting a weak plan that addresses only mercury.  This 
plan would delay and weaken reductions of mercury required in the Clean 
Air Act, and completely ignores more than 60 other power plant air toxics 
that threaten our health. We need a rule finalized as quickly as possible 
that requires maximum reductions in all air toxics from every applicable 
power plant unit within the shortest possible timeframe.

The EPA's docket of over 680,000 public comments from earlier this year 
proves that Americans want the highest standard of protection from toxic 
power plant emissions as soon as possible. Your agency promised to do the 
necessary analysis to ""get it right"" on mercury - analysis that would show 
how fast and how quickly mercury reductions could be made with new 
technology and stricter controls.  Instead, the Agency has reneged on its 
promises to analyze more stringent regulations and continues to promote an 
illegal pollution trading program for emissions of mercury.

I urge you not to ignore the law, which requires a stronger plan for 
faster reductions - in order to protect the health of the American people 
and future generations of children

Sincerely,
Melissa Drapeau

18,842 supporters of SierraRise, a Sierra Club community, have signed a petition opposing the proposed reclassification of the West Indian Manatee.

You can find the names of the 18,842 petition signatures in the attached document. The petition text that all signed is as follows:

I'm calling on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to continue protecting the West Indian Manatee.

The great work we have done in protecting these lumbering gentle giants is clear, as the population has rebounded since the early '90s. But over the last five years more than 3,000 manatees have died in the state of Florida. It's clear the population is still vulnerable. Therefore, we need to take every possible step to ensure the continued survival of these animals.

That's why I'm requesting that you reconsider your plans to reclassify the West Indian Manatee from ""endangered"" to ""threatened."" Do not undo the great work we have done so far in protecting these beloved marine mammals.
Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

The undersigned

Attached, please find comments submitted by 29,845 members and supporters of Americans for Tax Fairness and Daily Kos urging adoption of the proposed rule on Inversions and Related Transactions, also known as the ""serial inverter"" rule. We are very pleased that the Treasury Department took this action to protect the loss of critical tax dollars by U.S. corporations seeking to shift their legal address offshore, typically to a tax haven. This rulemaking is necessary because the U.S. Congress has failed to act to stem the tide of inversions.

Inversions are one of the more egregious forms of tax dodging. They occur when U.S. multinational corporations purchase a foreign company in order to shift their corporate headquarters on paper to a low-tax (or no-tax) jurisdiction to avoid paying U.S. corporate income taxes. These inversions do not change anything about how the business is conducted or where it is managed - they are simply a way for a corporation to avoid paying its fair share of taxes. Clearly, corporations that desert America should not be rewarded with a tax break.  
 
The serial inverter rule was critical in Pfizer's decision to end its proposed merger with Allergan, a serial inverter. This saved the loss of as much as $35 billion in taxes Pfizer owes on its offshore profits. But the Treasury Department's rule could be even stronger by applying it to all corporations that invert with a foreign firm. That would take away the ability of corporations that invert from doing a ""hopscotch loan,"" which lets them dodge paying U.S. taxes on the billions in offshore profits they have stashed in tax havens.

Get lead out of our drinking water (RE: EPA-HQ-OW-2015-0680-0001)

Dear Environmental Protection Agency:

We don't want lead in our drinking water pipes, fittings, fixtures, solder and flux. Requiring third-party certification is important to ensure that products meet national leaching standards for lead. The EPA must not remove this requirement from its regulations.

	For years, EPA policy has been to require third-party certification that pipes and fixtures do not leach unsafe amounts of lead.
	Lowering the amount of overall average lead allowed in a pipe or fixture is important, but it cannot replace the leaching standard.
	Even small leaded components can leach considerable amounts of dangerous lead. 
	Different alloys or manufacturing processes can also affect the amount of lead that leaches.
	If you want to keep people safe from lead, the only way to do it is to lower the amount of average lead allowed, as Congress did, and continue to require a third-party leaching test.

When Congress passed the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act, it was trying to protect our health. It defies reason to use this Act as an excuse to weaken lead protections for families in this country. Please continue to require third-party certification that proves products do not leach lead.

Sincerely,

The Undersigned","Use of Lead Free Pipes, Fittings, Fixtures, Solder and Flux for Drinking Water"

====================
I am writing to support the listing of the Western population of Yellow-billed Cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus occidentalis) as ""Threatened"" under the Endangered Species Act. As the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service analysis shows, this species has suffered a dramatic decline in the West as a result of the loss of its breeding habitat. 

Human interventions and impacts, including dams, water diversions, ground-water pumping, and other development are jeopardizing the continued existence of this species in the Western United States. In the arid West, where these birds were once common, documented breeding habitat loss is over ninety percent in comparison with a half-century ago. 

Extended drought and predicted climate change further jeopardize this species and add to the need for it to be listed as Threatened. 

The remaining strongholds for western Yellow-billed Cuckoo are the iconic wild rivers: the Colorado, Dolores, San Pedro, Gila, Sacramento, Rio Grande and Kern Rivers. Listing will help ensure that these rivers will be protected to conserve and restore this species and the habitats upon which it depends.

Many people submitted personalized comments, which you will find in the first worksheet; others signed on to the comments below: 

========================
I am writing to express my strong opposition to a deeply flawed proposal to remove the Southwestern Willow Flycatcher from protections under the Endangered Species Act. The Southwestern Willow Flycatcher is struggling to survive and should retain its Endangered status.

At the time the bird was listed as endangered in 1995, an expert panel convened by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service confirmed that the Southwestern Willow Flycatcher is a distinct subspecies worthy of protection, and there is nothing in this latest petition that casts doubt on that determination. One study, put forth by a researcher with financial ties to developers, should not be enough to overturn decades of objective research to the contrary.

The study that the petitioners rely upon has substantial limitations. While it purports to be the final word on DNA evidence, it is far from conclusive on the subject of the Southwestern Willow Flycatcher's status as a subspecies. A peer-reviewed journal article contends that the developers' research misinterprets its own genetic data and downplays significant differences in physical attributes and geological range between different subspecies.

The Southwestern Willow Flycatcher is an essential part of the ecology of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. Please support efforts to protect this bird from extinction and continue to coordinate with all federal agencies to protect vital water resources and rivers providing habitat these birds depend on.

Thank you for your strong history of standing up to these types of efforts to use questionable science to remove species from the protections afforded by the Endangered Species Act. Please stay strong and reject the current petition to remove the Southwestern Willow Flycatcher's Endangered status.

Dear U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 

I'm writing to share my support for the immediate designation of critical habitat on U.S. nesting beaches that are important to threatened loggerhead sea turtles as required under the Endangered Species Act. I support permanent the critical habitat protections proposed for 739 miles of coastline that cover 84 percent of nesting areas from North Carolina to Florida to Mississippi. 

In addition, I urge you to extend the critical habitat designation to all key Florida nesting beaches. Please do not exclude the three Florida counties covered by voluntary Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) as proposed by USFWS. These plans expire over time and are vulnerable to cut-backs and political agendas. Loggerheads live for decades so they need permanent habitat protections over hundreds of years. Critical Habitat under the ESA is long term and essentially permanent. I support the detailed comments by Turtle Island Restoration Network and its ocean partners on this topic. 

Lastly, I urge the USFWS to consider adding more nesting beaches, upland areas and unoccupied habitat to the proposed designation to provide loggerheads access to alternative nesting areas as populations increase and climate change triggers the rise of sea levels and sand temperatures that reduce current habitat. 

Thank you for your consideration and action as you finalize this important critical habitat proposal for the Northwest Atlantic population of loggerhead sea turtles.

To: EPA

I urge the Environmental Protection Agency to issue strong rules to curb methane and other harmful air pollution from oil and gas development (EPA-HQ-OAR-2010-0505 and EPA-HQ-OAR-2013-0685). While no amount of regulation can make fracked gas a clean energy source, I support efforts to capture methane, repair leaks, and aggregate disparate sources of methane and other air pollution along the oil and gas supply chain. These important pollution controls will not only help stave off catastrophic climate change but also protect communities from harm imposed by the oil and gas industry.

I urge you to improve the proposed rules to include

Several key pieces of equipment that were omitted from the proposal that emit methane and harmful VOCs.
Storage vessels that were covered under the VOC standards but are not included in the methane proposal.
Liquids-unloading operations.
Pneumatic controllers that operate on an intermittent or snap-acting basis.
Compressors at well sites.
Mandatory inspections at least quarterly or monthly (rather than a default semiannual requirement), which should remain at a fixed frequency rather than decreasing on low-leak-rate detection.
Shortening the time source operators have to repair leaking equipment if it would be unsafe to make the repair within 15 days of discovery.
Defining ""sources"" to include functionally interrelated equipment so regulators can aggregate individual emissions sources to prevent significant deterioration of our air quality.
Including communities in the pollution-detection process. A citizen complaint system is needed to allow communities living near fracked gas infrastructure to alert the EPA if they detect odors or air pollution events nearby.
Requiring oil and gas companies to use or bring to market captured gas, rather than flare it, unless extraordinary circumstances make flaring unavoidable.

In addition to these important changes to strengthen the proposals, I urge the EPA to regulate existing sources of methane pollution under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. Voluntary standards are insufficient to cut harmful, climate-disrupting methane pollution from oil and gas operations, and they will not adequately protect affected communities. To safeguard communities living with the burden of existing oil and gas infrastructure and to meet President Obama's Climate Action Plan goal of reducing oil and gas sector methane emissions 40 to 45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025, the EPA must move quickly to create rules for existing oil and gas facilities upstream, midstream, and downstream.

I support the EPA's proposals as a means to begin to address the climate crisis exacerbated by the fracking boom and reduce harm to communities living with the burden of the oil and gas industry. I urge the EPA to make the changes needed to ensure that these rules are sufficiently strong to protect public health and tackle climate change. Regulating existing sources of air pollution, coupled with an immediate shift to an economy that depends on clean, renewable energynot fossil fuelsare steps that must be followed to avoid the most devastating effects of catastrophic climate change.

water, and healthy fish and wildlife. We need to take steps now to protect our ocean for

support the overall criteria proposed by NOAA for evaluation potential nominations.  
However, I am concerned about how restrictions on oil and gas drilling will be considered 
within criteria 8 of the proposed regulation. Offshore oil and gas drilling is incompatible 
with the National Marine Sanctuary Program's mission to protect our most precious 
marine ecosystems. Protecting natural resources must be prioritized over potential future

------------------------------------------------------------
I am writing in support of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's proposed listing of the rufa Red Knot as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Rufa Red Knots, which migrate over 9,000 miles along the Atlantic coast from the Canadian Arctic to southern Argentina, have declined by about 75 percent since the 1980s from over 100,000 to about 25,000 today. These declines, and the broad threats that it faces across its range, make it vulnerable to extinction in the foreseeable future and an appropriate candidate for listing under the ESA.

Overfishing of horseshoe crab eggs in Delaware Bay has been the primary cause of the knot's decline, as birds that cannot fatten up for the last leg of their journey to their Arctic breeding grounds don't survive the trip or arrive in such poor condition that they cannot nest successfully. However, coastal development and engineering projects, as well as chronic disturbance, at migratory stopover sites throughout the U.S. have also depleted feeding and resting habitat for migrating Red Knots. In addition, climate change has been identified as affecting conditions in the Arctic and elsewhere, mismatching the timing of food availability for migrating and breeding knots.

The threats to the rufa Red Knot and its incredible journey are so large and systemic that state and local action, such as New Jersey's moratorium on horseshoe crab fishing in its portion of Delaware Bay, are insufficient to meet the challenges of conserving Red Knots for future generations. Federal listing will provide additional protections, research, and management needed to halt current precipitous declines and recover Red Knot populations. That is why I support the proposed listing of the rufa Red Knot.

Attn: FWS-R4-ES-2015-0132-0001 Kentucky Arrow Darter listing

I am writing in support of Endangered Species Act protection for the Kentucky arrow darter. This unique species, found nowhere else on earth, has already disappeared from nearly half of its historical range -- 36 of 74 streams -- and surviving populations are at high risk. 44 percent of this loss has occurred only since the mid-1990s. 

The darter is threatened by habitat loss from many activities including coal mining, logging, land development, and oil and gas development. It is also vulnerable to global climate change. The best available information clearly shows that the darter warrants federal protection. 

Protecting the streams that the darter needs to survive will also protect other species and people in its watersheds. Please promptly finalize protection for the Kentucky arrow darter and for its critical habitat. 

The darter makes up a special part of the natural heritage of eastern Kentucky, and I urge you to safeguard it for future generations.

The arrow darter was once found in 74 streams, but today it's only in 38. Nearly half of that loss happened in the last twenty years -- since mountaintop removal mining picked up and polluted the water with metals and other contaminants. 

It's clear that urgent action is needed to protect the Kentucky arrow darter, you have a chance to make a dramatic difference in the continuation of this species while protecting other nearby animals and communities.

Mr. Stephen Johnson

Dear Mr. Johnson,

The Environmental Protection Agency should stop its misguided and
illegal effort to exempt factory farms from reporting their toxic air
releases. Some large factory farms release millions of pounds of toxic
chemicals, such as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which are formed as
animal manure degrades.  Why should the EPA create a special-interest
exemption for factory farms when they release the exact same chemicals
as manufacturing facilities that are required to report releases?
Congress intended for the public to have the right to know about large
releases of toxic chemicals, and this proposed regulation directly
contradicts the intent of Congress.  I urge you not to exempt factory
farms from the requirement to report toxic air releases.
Collecting information on toxic chemical releases from factory farms
is critical.  A number of studies, including one by Iowa State

University and the University of Iowa in 2002, have found a variety of

health problems among factory farm workers and residents who live near
these operations, including bronchitis, asthma and

antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.  People who live near these

facilities should have the right to know what hazardous chemicals they
are being exposed to. The EPA should not exempt factory farms from
these important laws.

Sincerely,

Ms Linda Judd

Dear Administrator Pruitt:

Enclosed please find copies of 670 letters signed by citizens urging the EPA to finalize the draft CERCLA financial responsibility rules that would protect taxpayers from costs for hardrock mining water pollution cleanup. These comments reflect concerns based on experiences in Minnesota and request that the EPA adopt preferred Option 1 that precludes corporate guarantees.

Three attachments are provided: 642 letters signed online, one unique letter signed online, and 27 letters signed in paper copy. All online letters were downloaded without changes and reflect verbatim the letters signed by the individuals whose names appear beneath the text.

Dear EPA Administrator, 

I am writing today to urge the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to complete rigorous financial assurance regulations as required under CERCLA 108(b) to protect taxpayers from the clean-up costs associated with metal mines and to ensure timely clean-up to protect communities from the hazardous materials associated with these mines. 

Strong financial assurance regulations are needed to protect the American taxpayer from the burden of clean-up costs associated with mining industry - the nation's leading source of toxic pollution.  With an estimated backlog of $20-54 billion for clean-up of hardrock mines, American taxpayers are already unfairly faced with an enormous financial burden. For example:

	In Montana, taxpayers have already spent roughly $26 million to treat toxic acid mine drainage at the Zortman Landusky Mine.
	In South Dakota, $100 million has been spent at the Gilt Edge Mine and another $89 million is needed. 
	In Nevada, the Yerington Mine will cost taxpayers more than $30 million just to address the most immediate public health and safety threats. 
	In Oregon, acid mine drainage at the Formosa Mine has caused extensive, unfunded,  damage to water resources.
	In Colorado, the Summitville mine left taxpayers to fund more than $100 million in cleanup costs. 

The EPA estimates that based on current funding levels, ($100-150 million per year), no more than 8-20% of all cleanup work could be completed within 30 years. These rules are necessary to shift the financial responsibility for remediation to the industry, not the taxpayer, and to ensure timely clean-up. 

I strongly support the EPA's preferred option (Option 1) that precludes the use of corporate guarantees, or mere promises, as an instrument for financial assurance.  Corporate or ""self"" guarantees are no guarantee at all because they are not backed by real assets, cash or cash equivalents.  It conflicts with the purpose of the rule-making because it places the financial risk primarily on the American taxpayer, rather than the polluter. 

These rules are essential because the hazardous releases covered by the CERCLA 108(b) program, such as hazardous spills, natural resource damages and public health assessment, are not covered by other state and federal state land management regulatory programs. 

Any reductions to the financial assurance calculations must only be applied for engineering controls that are installed and demonstrated to be working to reduce the scope and severity of hazardous releases; not mere plans. 

Program deferrals should not be authorized because the risks and liabilities under CERCLA 108(b) differ from those of state and other federal land management agencies. The EPA cannot ensure compliance with the statute if the program is deferred.  

These rules follow a simple and fair principle: If you make a mess; you clean it up. ","CERCLA 108(b) Financial Responsibility Requirements for Facilities in the Hard Rock Mining Industry; Proposed Rule"

Monsanto's genetically engineered Roundup Ready crops are planted on over 150 million acres nationwide. They have triggered a huge increase in the use of glyphosate (Roundup) herbicide, and an epidemic of glyphosate-resistant ""superweeds."" Now, in a misguided effort to fix the weed resistance problem created by its Roundup Ready crops, Monsanto has genetically engineered soybeans and cotton to be resistant to more toxic herbicides like dicamba. 

If EPA approves this new use, millions more pounds of dicamba will be sprayed together with continuing heavy use of glyphosate. EPA's proposed approval would significantly increase use of dicamba, creating the risk of weed resistance.
Dicamba is an older herbicide that studies have linked to higher risk of cancers like non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as developmental toxicity; other tests indicate the potential for neurological impacts. Dicamba is soluble in water and moderately persistent, and so carries a large surface water and groundwater contamination risk. Dicamba is also volatile and can drift for miles. Dicamba drift has caused millions of dollars in damages to growers who have suffered crop losses due to herbicide drift onto their farms. The proposed approval would also damage and harm other crops and species, including threatened and endangered species, because dicamba is drift-prone and volatile.

Inevitably, increased use of dicamba will generate new ""superweeds"" resistant to multiple herbicides, and the chemical arms race with weeds will continue. This means more pesticide pollution, more disease and environmental damage, and of course, increasing profits for firms like Monsanto that sell both dicamba-resistant seeds and the herbicides used with them. 

At a time when farmers, citizens, and government have worked hard to limit our use of, and exposure to, hazardous pesticides like dicamba, approving new use of dicamba for Monsanto's dicamba resistant cotton and soybeans would take us backwards, seriously endangering human health and the environment.

Docket No. MMS-2008-OMM-0012
AD30 - Alternative Energy and Alternate Uses of Existing Facilities on the OCS.

September 8, 2008

Please find attached a ocver letter and 3,648 public comments on Docket No. 
MMS-2008-OMM-0012 from Center for Food Safety members opposing rules in 
the AEAU on the OCS that would allow existing and new energy facilities—such 
as oil rigs and fish farms—to be used as parent sites for the development of 
polluting, industrial scale open ocean aquaculture facilities. 

The Center for Food Safety (CFS) is a national, non-profit, membership 
organization founded in 1997 to protect human health and the environment by 
curbing the use of harmful food production technologies and by promoting organic 
and other forms of sustainable agriculture. CFS represents approximately 67,000 
members.

Marine aquaculture could significantly harm the environment, human health, and 
the economies of local fishing communities. Offshore aquaculture in the United 
States could pose many of the same documented problems as large-scale net 
pen and cage aquaculture have created around the world, including, but not limited 
to pollution, escapement, and heavy use of wild fish in feed. In terms of pollution 
from aquaculture, fish feces and uneaten feed flow freely out of cages and into the 
environment. The escapement of salmon, halibut, and cod from ocean fish farms 
is another chronic problem. Furthermore, the species proposed for aquaculture in 
U.S. federal waters rely on high quantities of fishmeal and fish oil to meet their 
dietary needs. Finally, offshore aquaculture in the U.S. could cause negative 
socioeconomic impacts through environmental impacts and by competing with the 
existing seafood industry and communities.

Oil, gas or other energy facilities, whether currently in use or not, are not the 
appropriate location for offshore aquaculture operations. Had aquaculture facilities 
existed on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico during violent storms in recent years, 
there could have been massive releases of captive fish, feed, and other pollutants 
directly into ocean waters. Oil and gas rigs, or other energy facilities, active or 
decommissioned, should not be substituted for best available technology in open 
water aquaculture. MMS is not equipped to comprehensively manage a new 
industry, especially one Congress has thus far found to be a dubious endeavor. 

There are currently two bills pending in Congress that would set up a permitting 
regime for offshore aquaculture. Congress has thus far rejected these federal bills, 
in part because they did not have strong environmental and socioeconomic 
standards to guide the NOAA's decision-making. Without a bill with strong 
environmental and socioeconomic protections, there should be no offshore 
aquaculture facilities in U.S. federal waters. MMS should not use this rulemaking 
to bypass Congress.

MMS should not finalize a program such as this one, which fails to have strong 
standards limiting aquaculture facilities' impacts from fish waste and fish feed 
effluent, use of fishmeal and fish oil, escapes, and disease, all of which can harm 
the marine environment and the fishing communities that rely on them.

Thank you for taking our concerns under consideration,

Dear Secretary DeVos: 
 
I oppose the U.S. Department of Educations attempt to allow for-profit colleges to receive federal student aid while forcing students to give up their right to take schools to court if they are cheated or wronged by the school. Forced arbitration provisions, together with class-action bans and gag clauses that prevent students from discussing arbitration proceedings with other students, have stopped students from accessing the court system to bring claims of wrongdoing against for-profit schools, including claims against the now-shuttered Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute. 
 
The vast majority of nonprofit and public institutions already refuse to include these shameful provisions in their contracts, but we need protections against unethical for-profit colleges. The department should not abandon a fair and strong rule that would protect students. 
 
We urge you to uphold students right to their day in court by prohibiting predatory, for-profit colleges from receiving federal funds if they force their students into biased arbitration rather than allowing them to bring claims in a neutral, open court.

I support the placement of the Anaconda Copper Mine on the National Priorities List. 

The problems at the mine have been public since approximately 2003 and [supporters of NPL listing have] attended numerous meetings regarding the situation, both technical and community meetings. 

Though the EPA and Atlantic Richfield have completed several cleanup actions since that time under emergency regulations, it is clear that the most consequential remaining problem, contaminated groundwater from the mine proceeding towards a major aquifer, can only be addressed by placing the entire site on the National Priorities List. 

Some community members and elected officials from Yerington and Lyon County have proposed other alternatives for dealing with the issues and none were viable; in the meantime those living north of the mine, the most affected, have radionuclides at illegal levels in their well water and the contaminated groundwater plume continues north. 

Therefore I believe it is past time to ""list"" the mine. Please place the Anaconda Mine on the NPL list at the earliest opportunity, so remediation finally can be completed.

Attached are more than 2,000 letters from Clean Water Action members across the country who strongly oppose your proposal to delay the implementation deadlines for the 2015 Clean Water Rule, which became effective on August 28, 2015 after being adopted with overwhelming public support. Instead the Clean Water Rule should be implemented as soon as EPA is authorized to do so.

Our nation has already lost over half our wetlands and continues to lose more at an alarming rate. For too long small and headwater streams, which make up the majority of stream miles in the U.S., have been at increased risk of pollution. The Clean Water Rule is needed to help protect these vital water resources that buffer communities from flood waters, filter pollutants, and feed the drinking water sources for over 1 and 3 people.

We urge EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to immediately withdraw this reckless proposal to delay critical clean water protections and instead move swiftly to implement the 2015 Clean Water Rule as soon as they are authorized to do so.

Thank you for considering our concerns.

Docket #: EPA-HQ-OLEM-2016-0152

San Juan Citizens Alliance (SJCA) has been working in Southwest Colorado since 1986. During that time we have established a record of success in building and implementing effective and collaborative campaigns to protect the health of our region's air, land and water. Our dedication to community-based advocacy and organizing has earned the organization respect and support in local communities. 

Today, we represent our nearly 700 dues-paying members and 4,000 supporters, as well as the 418 supporters who signed the petition included below, in urging you to officially add the Bonita Peak Mining District to the National Priorities List.

The names of all signatories, including their city and state of residence, are attached. This list represents the overwhelming desire of locals and non-locals alike to finally clean up the massive and destructive legacy hard rock mining has left in our watershed. 

Over the years, SJCA has participated in efforts to clean up the headwaters of the Animas River. It has become increasingly clear, however, that grassroots efforts are insufficient to solve this massive and complicated threat. The Gold King Mine blowout of August 2015 demonstrated the striking vulnerability of downstream communities. It made the stakes of inaction frighteningly clear. 

The Gold King Mine disaster and continued existence of un-remediated inactive and interconnected mines in the region continue to threaten the livelihoods, businesses and health of communities spanning multiple municipalities, counties, states and sovereign nations. Elected officials and communities have overwhelmingly spoken out in favor of adding the region to the National Priorities List. We join them. Clean water is a right, one that is currently threatened. Please help our community access the needed technical and financial resources to ensure our children know a cleaner watershed.



PETITION

Dear Administrator McCarthy, 

Following the Gold King Mine disaster of August, 2015, communities up and down the Animas River watershed banded together to address the longstanding pollution caused by acid mine drainage. After considerable deliberation, it has been nearly universally determined that listing the region on the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) is a critical and necessary mechanism for finally realizing the clean up of more than a century of mining waste. 

In recent months, the towns of Silverton and Durango, Colorado, along with their respective counties, San Juan County and La Plata County, have found common ground in their support of a NPL listing. This shared commitment to securing a place on the NPL is further strengthened by the support of the Navajo Nation, Senator Bennet of Colorado, Senators Udall and Heinrich of New Mexico and Representative Lujn of New Mexico. 

As community members, we whole-heartedly support the Environmental Protection Agency listing the Bonita Peak Mining District on the National Priorities List, making the area eligible for long-term clean up through the Superfund program. With your assistance, we will finally begin to reclaim the health of our beloved Animas and San Juan Rivers

We encourage the Environmental Protection Agency to add the Bonita Peak Mining District to the Superfund National Priorities List. This area includes the Gold King mine, which spilled over 3 million gallons of toxic sludge into the Animas River in August of 2015. Ten months after this disastrous mine spill, leakage continues to contaminate the Animas River downstream. Residents of nearby communities in Southwest Colorado will continue to be at risk without the superfund designation and following cleanup so I urge the EPA to take action.

"4221",894,894,NA,NA,"MN Haze SIP: National Parks Conservation Association letter campaign (894 similar/duplicate comments)","I'm writing to urge you to work with Minnesota and Federal Land Managers to adopt an 
adequate haze plan for Minnesota that includes specific requirements to reduce air pollution 
at the coal plants and taconite facilities that are polluting the region's treasured landscapes.

As a national park visitor and advocate for the parks, I value the beauty of Voyageurs and Isle 
Royale National Parks. An adequate haze plan would clean up the air in these parks and 
other wilderness areas, which are affected by pollution from power plants and taconite 
facilities.

As currently written, the Minnesota haze plan fails to require some of the most egregious air 
polluters in the state--coal and taconite plants--to use the most effective emissions control 
technologies to protect and restore air quality to our region's wild lands. The Minnesota plan 
lets polluters rely on alternative measures that will not clean up enough pollution to protect 
our national parks. Instead of exempting Minnesota polluters from the most effective 
emissions control technologies, EPA must require appropriate emission reduction from 
Minnesota polluters.

Pollution from coal-fired power plants and taconite facilities have hurt our national parks and 
wilderness areas for too long. EPA cannot let Minnesota polluters escape pollution controls; 
it must require that the air in our parks, and throughout the region, be cleaned up for present 
and future generations.

Thank you for considering my comments.","Minnesota Regional Haze SIP"

Please find the two attached PDF comments for Docket ID: EPA-HQ-OW-2012-0195 (Notice of Intent to revise stormwater regulations for logging roads).

The simple message is this:

""We value clean water and wild fish. Industrial logging roads are a leading cause of sediment pollution and we believe it is time for the logging industry to do its fair share to protect water quality. We oppose efforts to exempt the timber industry and logging roads from the Clean Water Act. Please ensure that industrial logging road pollution remains regulated under the Clean Water Act’s permit program.""

To excerpt one of the personalized comments:

""The vast majority of the drainage ditches for logging roads clearly meet the definition of a ""point source"" that has been in the CWA since its creation in 1972. For decades, EPA has ignored this fact, and the result is continued degredation of thousands of miles of streams and lakes nationwide. The forest industry has had a 40 year reprieve from being held accountable under the CWA, during which they could have proven that voluntary measures (self-policing) would work. The facts prove otherwise."" - Bill Painter, Mint Spring, Virginia

Please confirm receipt. Thank you.

For a future with wild salmon in Pacific Northwest streams,

"4266",251,251,NA,NA,"Mass Comment Campaign, Sponsor Unknown entitled "" I am concerned about the sweeping changes that EPA has proposed in its Certification of Pesticide Applicators Rule"" (251 comments)","As a farmer, rancher, and certified pesticide applicator in Texas, I am concerned about the sweeping changes that EPA has proposed in its Certification of Pesticide Applicators Rule.
Why are these changes needed?  The rulemaking cites a number of reports and studies; however, none link pesticide-related illnesses to certified applicator competency.  Why does EPA believe that more ridged federal standards are needed to reduce the number of pesticide-related illnesses when there is no established connection between the two?

Texas, like many other states, has had an effective program in place for many years.  It does not need to be changed.

The 3-year certification length proposed in the rule is arbitrary.  There is no reason to limit the length of certification particularly if a state requires applicators to complete periodic CEUs trainings to maintain the certification.  In Texas, private applicators renew their license every 5 years and commercial applicators renew their licenses annually.  This system works well.

The amount of training proposed solely for Core Competency (6 CEUs per 3 years) is excessive.  Repeated training on the same core subject matter would quickly become repetitive and redundant.  

The method-specific competency standards proposed are overly burdensome.  EPA should consider removing all method-specific categories for private applicators. Re-certification requirements for commercial applicators should be reduced as well. Many commercial applicators would need certification in 6 to 8 separate method-specific categories.  Under the proposed rule, that would mean 42 to 54 CEUs every 3 years when Core Competency requirements are included.  This is excessive.

Proposed changes to the minimum age requirement is also a concern.  To be consistent with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), EPA should adopt a minimum age of 16 (rather than 18) for both certified and non-certified pesticide applicators working on farms or in the agricultural sector.  EPA should observe similar exemptions offered to family members under the FLSA.

Despite perceived shortcomings with the current pesticide applicators rule, existing state programs are working well and do not need to be changed.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule.","Certification of Pesticide Applicators Rule Revision (40 CFR 171)"

To the FDA:

Please do not approve genetically engineered salmon. The health risks of consuming salmon that has been genetically altered to produce growth hormones at all times are unknown. Your claim that genetically engineered salmon is safe to eat is based on an assumption, not on rigorous scientific investigation.

The accidental release of transgenic salmon could be devastating to marine ecosystems and wild salmon populations. It is naïve to assume that no transgenic fish will escape into the wild. The National Academy of Sciences wrote that release of transgenic fish is “of immediate concern” and “might pose environmental hazards.” These impacts would likely be irreversible.

I urge you to put human health, the environment, and the economic well-being of coastal fishing communities first. The FDA should rely on independent and credible science, not on science supplied by the corporation that stands to profit from your approval.

Please delay approval of genetically engineered salmon until the results of independent scientific studies show that genetically engineered fish is safe to eat and harmless to the environment.

Please also require the labeling of GE foods, to allow consumers to make an informed choice.

Re: Docket ID OSHA- 2010-0034, Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica  

Dear Assistant Secretary Michaels:  

As an employer in the construction industry, I am writing in response to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) above-referenced notice of proposed rulemaking on occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica, which was published in the Federal Register on September 12, 2013, at 78 Fed. Reg. 56274. The proposed rule drastically lowers the Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for crystalline silica and requires contractors to implement engineering controls and follow several ""ancillary"" provisions, such as exposure monitoring, medical surveillance and the establishment of regulated areas.  

As a construction employer, I believe exceptional jobsite safety and health practices are inherently good for business. However, the proposed rule is potentially the most far-reaching regulatory initiative proposed by OSHA for the construction industry.  Silica is found in numerous building materials and can easily be disturbed by a number of job tasks found on the worksite. The proposed rule uses an overly complicated structure to control crystalline silica in a construction environment. OSHA must understand that this material cannot be separated out of daily tasks or avoided on the worksite. 

The proposed rule drastically lowers the PEL to 50 ?g/m3, with an action level of 25 ?g/m3. It is important to note that construction previously had a PEL of 250 ?g/m3, versus the general industry PEL of 100 ?g/m3. OSHA states the reason for lowering the PELs is the current levels result in significant risk of material health impairment among exposed workers. However, recent studies show there is a significant downward trend of incidences of silicosis under the current PEL levels.  The proposed PEL and action level are simply not feasible for the construction industry to attain in most operations most of the time. The control measures that OSHA relies on under its own analysis do not reliably reduce silica exposures in construction to those levels and OSHA does not account for the variety of construction environments that exist throughout the United States.

OSHA proposed Table 1 as a means of compliance with the exposure monitoring and methods of compliance provisions for the construction industry. While I appreciate that OSHA attempted to recognize the unique nature of construction through its proposed Table 1, it ultimately falls short and would be unworkable for me to implement as an employer. One of the main reasons Table 1 is ineffective can be found in the ""Engineering and work practice control methods"" section of the table, which states that there be ""no visible dust"" emitted from a process after the introduction of the engineering control methods. Even through the use of wet methods or engineering controls, rarely-if ever-will there be no visible dust emitted from silica generated activities. Therefore, Table 1 as written would not be a viable path for reaching compliance. 

OSHA has not shown that the proposed rule is technologically or economically feasible for the construction industry. Many of the provisions in the rule making simply will not work in the ""real world"" of construction. OSHA should withdraw its burdensome proposal until it can demonstrate a rule making of this kind is necessary and workable. The unintended consequences of this sort of extreme regulation, is that it can lead to greater unemployment in an industry that has already suffered considerably in the past few years. Therefore, I encourage OSHA to work with the construction industry to ensure that the actions taken are sober, reasonable and can achieve positive results without jeopardizing the employment opportunities for a large section of the American workforce.

Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this matter.","Occupational Exposure to Crystalline Silica"
