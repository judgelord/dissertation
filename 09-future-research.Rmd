## Future research 

### Interest Group Represnetation

To the extent that public pressure campaigns shape agency decisions, a broader research program is needed to investigate who exactly these campaigns mobilize and represent. My analysis of second-order representation in comments raising environmental justice concerns shows that the large national advocacy groups that dominate public pressure organizing often claim to represent groups that are often exlcuded from policymaking. Sometimes this is done in collaboration with disenfranchised groups and sometimes it is not. Much more research is needed to assess the quality of second-order representation in coalition lobbhing. 

Unlike classic pluralist assumptions about how interest group representation opperates---where an oprganztion represents a defined class or membership---pressure campaigns mobilize and open-ended list of potential supporters that theoreically includes most of the public. Indeed, a key piece of political information that campaings generate is signals about the potential for a a movement to grow and further expand the scope of conflict. For example, a large public pressure campaign may signal that more letter-writing campaigns targeing members of Congress, protests, and the resulting media attention are possible, depending on policymakers' decisions.

### Networks and Lobbying Coalitions

In Chapter \@ref(whymail), I show that most public pressure campaigns are coordinated by a relatively small number of organizations that lobby repeatedly both with and without pressure campaings. Lobbying coalitions range from two organizations to hundreds.
Thses data are flush with opprtuities for network analysis.  We know that organizations mobilize other organizations to join their lobbying effors [@Nelson2012; @English2019]. Simple measures like node centrality may tell us a great deal about the structure of advocacy coalitions and how they change over time and across policy areas. 

Anicdotes from my data pose questions for network research.
For example, large environmental organizations increasingly use environmental justice rhetoric; is this related to the number of ties they have to frontline activst groups? If so, did the ties or the rhetoric come first? By observing the same organizations lobbying in different coalitions over time, these data allow time-varient network analysis. Another example: environmental groups often supported the Obama-administration's policies, but occassionaly opposed them. When they did, one of their key progressive allies in mobilizing efforts, Organizing For America, formerly President Obama's campaing organation, Obama For America, was conspiciously absent from the coalition. These data allow network analysis with lobbying coalition and policy-level covariates (e.g., supporting or opposing a given president's agenda). 


### Public Pressure and Congressional Oversight

Members of Congress engage in agency policymaking in a variety of ways, only some of which are systematically captured in the data used to estimate the relationship between public pressure and legislator behavior in \@ref(influence-results). Comparing the dataset on congressional behaivor I have assmebled thorugh this dissertation to other data on congressional engagment in bureaucratic policymaking could yield insights about both legislative behavior and bureaucratic policymaking. For example, when members of Congress submit official "comments" on an agency rule or forward their constituent comments (often, legislators do both) they are almost ceritanly logged in the public recored on regulations.gov. However, if do not want their communications to appear in the public record, they may contact a different office (for example, the secretary's office rather than the program office issuing the rule). @Judge-Lord2018APSA find sysetmatic variation in how members contact agencies and sub-bureaus, and @Powell2020 show that legislators often advocate on behalof of campaign donors. 


### Endogeniety

Assessing the impact of pressure campaings is difficult because an organizing's decision is endogenous to the organzaitions percieved probabilty of success and correlated with other factors we care about (for example, whether the organization is a business or nonprofit).
Future research might make disentangle different motivations for launching campaings by measuring the amount of effort that organizations put into sophisticated lobbying. While different types of organziations have different capacities for sophisticated lobbying (e.g. the ability to hire lawyers and scientitists), there is also varition with organizions on the amount of effort they put into sophisticated lobbying. Small investments in sophisticated lobbying relative to the scale of public organizing may indicate that the organization was mobilizing supporters for reasons other than affecting policy. (It could also indicate that the organzation percieve the policy fight to be more political than technical). This approach does not fully address the problem that lobbying behavior depends on expected probability of success, but it may at least capture the extreme cases where organizations mobilize primarily for reasons other than influencing the policy at hand. 

### Mechanisms of Influence

As theorized in \@ref(why-theory) and \@ref(influence-theory), the causal process potentially linking public pressure and policy decisions depends on how institutions filter and process the information they recieve. When agencies recieve large amounts of public comments, they often hire private-sector consultants to process and summarize public input. The insturctions that agencies give to their consultants and the summaries that consultants produce offer a rich and systematic way to study the processing of political information. Researchers shoulbe able to obtain these through Freedom of Information Act requests. 

### Methods of Measuring Policy Influence

Chapters \@ref(influence) and \@ref(ej) offer three methods to assess the impact of public pressure on bureaucratic policymaking: large-scale hand-coded of lobbying success, detailed case studies, and computational methods that measure change between draft and final policy documents. Each of these methods could be improved upon. 

The measures of lobbying success, position, and opposition used in Chapter \@ref(influence) do not distinguish different dimensions of conflict within each policy. For example, tribal governments and advocacy organizations often lobbying in coalion with environmental groups against extractive industries on public lands, but raise distinct objections related to tribal sovergty. While I distinguish tribal soverignty intersts as a distinct and overlaping lobbing coalition, I do not distinguish which of their multiple interests are opposed. My data currently reduce support and opposition to a single sppatial dimension, meaning that all reasons for supporting a policy are considered to be "opposed" if another coalition opposes the rule (even if for a different reason). This coding could be refined by disaggregating polices into multiple issues (dimensions of conflict) and assessing coalition lobbying dynamics on each dimension of conflict.

While I do not explicity engage the vast literature on "process tracing" methods in the qualitative parts of Chapter \@ref(ej), these methods informed my approach. Because notice-and-comment rulemaking under the Administrative Proceedures Act is unusually structed policy process, it is an excellent candidate for these methods. Compared to almost any other political phenonoma, rulemaking has clear inputs, outputs, and critical junctures that can be aligned and compared across mulitple observations. Cases where rules spa multiple adminisrations (like the Mercury rule discussed in \@ref(ej)) and rules that reverse rules published under previous adminisrations may be especially good canidates for process tracing. While atypical and inconvient for the present research, the fact that the Trump adminisration published new rules on many of the same rulemaking dockets on which the Obama adminisration published rules presents clear criteria for slecting rules that are clearly related to previous rules. 

There are opportunities to improve computational mearsures of policy change and lobbying success [@Carpenter2020]. Using the same methods I use group comments into coalitions (Section \@ref(why-methods)) and assess change in how policy documents discussed environmental justice (Section \@(ej-methods)), we can systematically capture which words (and thus the percent of words) changed between draft and final policy text. The challenge is linking these changes to commenter demands, which may also be done through my text reuse methods or a combination of other text similarity measures [@Rashin2017].

We may also combine hand-codeing and computational text analysis tools. I will focus on two of the many opportunities on this front: using hand-coded data as training data for machine learning tools and using computational to analize hand-selected parts of text. First, hand-coded lobbying coalitions provide a corpuse of related texts that may be used to train classifiers to automatically detect lobbying coalitions. Trained classifiers may perfom much better than unsupervised (models not trained on coded data) clustering methods. 

Second, human coders are particuly adept at identifying and classifying important parts of texts. For example, humans can easily identify sentences where commenters suggest policy changes.  Once identified, computational tools that rely on similar words and phrases to link comments with changes in policy text may provide much better measures of lobbying success than they would if using the entire text of a comment. Additionally, hand-coded metadata, such as the pro/con position of a comment may help aviod challenges that natural language processing tools have with sematic features like negation. For example, we will be much more confident in whether an organization is asking an agency to make a change or not to make a change. Finally, hand-coded lobbying coalitions can allow inferences about lobbying success to leverage larger pools of texts that we know are asking for similar policy changes.
