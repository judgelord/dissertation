Formally, political information requires several crucial amendments to
existing information-based models of rulemaking. In the most
sophisticated model of notice-and-comment rulemaking to date,
@Libgober2018 posits a utility function for agency $G$ as
$u_G(x_F) = \alpha_0 x_f^2 + \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i u_i (x_f)$ where
$x_f$ is the spatial location of the final policy, $u_i$ is the
preference of a member of the public or "potential commenter" $i$, and
$\alpha$ is a vector of \"allocational bias\"---i.e. how much the agency decisionmakers
care about their own preferences $\alpha_0$ relative to accommodating the
preferences of others $\alpha_{i=1:N}$. Bureaucrats balance their own
idea of their mission against their desire to be responsive. In
Libgober's model, $\alpha$ is a fixed "taste" for responsiveness to each
member of society, so agency decisions simply depend on their answer to
the question "what do people want?" Including political information
requires two additional parameters related to a second question "why
would agency officials care?"

Like other lobbying strategies, public pressure campaigns may shift the
strategic environment, leading an agency to shift its allocation in
favor of some groups and away from others. Let this strategic shift be a
vector $\alpha_s$. Second, campaigns may directly persuade agency officials to
adjust their allocational bias, for example by supporting claims about
the number of people the group represents or the intensity or legitimacy
of their policy demands. Let this direct shift be $\alpha_d$ and
immutable taste now be $\alpha_t$. Having decomposed an agency's
allocative bias into three parts (its fixed tastes, shifting strategic
environment, and potential to be convinced), the agency's utility
function is now
$u_G(x_F) =  (\alpha_{t0} + \alpha_{s0} + \alpha_{d0}) x_f^2 + \sum_{i=1}^N (\alpha_{ti} + \alpha_{si} + \alpha_{di}) u_i (x_f)$.
If, after the comment period, the strategic environment is
unchanged and officials remains unpersuaded about which segments of society
deserve favor, $\alpha_s$ and $\alpha_d$ are 0, and the model collapses
to the original information game based on fixed taste. This less
plausible when groups go public and expand the scope of conflict.
