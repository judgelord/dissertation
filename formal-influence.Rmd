In the most
sophisticated model of notice-and-comment rulemaking to date,
@Libgober2018 posits a utility function for policymaker $G$ as shown in Equation \@ref(eq:formal-libgober)

\begin{equation}
u_G(x_F) = \alpha_0 x_f^2 + \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i u_i (x_f) (\#eq:formal-libgober)
\end{equation}

where
$x_f$ is the spatial location of the final policy, $u_i$ is the
preference of "potential commenter" $i$, and
$\alpha$ is a vector of "allocational bias"---i.e. how much the agency decisionmakers
care about their own preferences $\alpha_0$ relative to accommodating the
preferences of others $\alpha_{i=1:N}$. Bureaucrats balance their own
idea of their mission against their desire to be responsive. In
Libgober's model, $\alpha$ is a fixed "taste" for responsiveness to each
member of society, so agency decisions simply depend on their answer to
the question "what do people want?"
Incorporating the insight about the power of technical information, we might consider $\alpha_0$ (the policymakers' understanding of their own prefrences) to be affected by technical information. Including political information
requires two additional parameters related to a second question "why
would agency officials care?" <!--CITE THIS IN EJ CHAPTER--> 

Like other lobbying strategies, public attention and pressure may shift the
strategic environment, leading policymakers to shift their allocation in
favor of some groups and away from others. Let this strategic shift in allocation be a
vector $\alpha_s$. Second, campaigns may directly persuade agency officials to
adjust their allocational bias, for example by supporting claims about
the number of people a group represents or the intensity or legitimacy
of their policy demands. Let this direct shift in allocations be $\alpha_d$. Let policymakers' immutable taste now be $\alpha_t$. Having decomposed an policymaker's
allocative bias into three parts (its fixed tastes, shifting strategic
environment, and potential to be convinced), the policymaker's utility
function is now Equation \@ref(eq:formal).

\begin{equation}
u_G(x_F) =  (\alpha_{t0} + \alpha_{s0} + \alpha_{d0}) x_f^2 + \sum_{i=1}^N (\alpha_{ti} + \alpha_{si} + \alpha_{di}) u_i (x_f) (\#eq:formal)
\end{equation}

If, after the comment period, the strategic environment is
unchanged and officials remains unpersuaded about which segments of society
deserve favor, $\alpha_s$ and $\alpha_d$ are 0, and the model collapses
to the original information game based on fixed tastes. This outcome is less
plausible when groups go public and expand the scope of conflict.

Adding these parameters resolves a puzzling result of Libgober's
model. Empirically, rules that receive comments do not always change.
This result is impossible in a model where bureaucrats only have known
fixed tastes and potential commenters only seek changes in policy. For
policy seeking organizations to lobby but fail to influence policy
requires that they are either wrong about an agency's allocative bias
or their ability to shift it. Incorporating political information allows
change and uncertainty in an agency's biases.
