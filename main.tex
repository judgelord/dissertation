\section{Theory} 
% MAIN QUESTION 
\paragraph{Incorporating mass engagement into theories of bureaucratic policymaking.}
How, if at all, should scholars incorporate mass engagement into models of bureaucratic policymaking? 
I argue that mass engagement produces potentially valuable political information about the coalition that mobilized it.
Thus, depending on how agencies process political information, ``going public'' may occasionally be an effective strategy for organizations to influence policy, both directly and indirectly.

% % PREVIEW 
\paragraph{Dissertation outline.}
Does mass engagement in bureaucratic policymaking affect policy? This question drives the my project. However, two questions must be answered first: (1) Why does it occur? and (2) How does it affect political oversight? These questions drive two initial empirical chapters. Thus, my analysis has three steps.

The next section builds a causal theory for each step. First, I theorize that activists' opportunities and strategies and latent public opinion drive engagement. Second I theorize that variation in mass engagement will lead to variation in political oversight. Third, I theorize that mass engagement may affect rulemaking both directly, and indirectly via its affect on political oversight.

The following section outlines methodologies to assess my three overarching questions and their component parts. Theses methods rely on analysis of comment and policy texts as large-n observational data. 

To explore causal arguments, the last two chapters of the dissertation will explore historical and experimental case studies. My historical case is the environmental justice movement, relying on all rules where ``environmental justice'' is raised in the comments and quantitative and qualitative assessment of agency responses. This prospectus includes preliminary analysis of the environmental justice case study. I find that responsiveness to activist comments varies in predictable ways across agencies but I find no evidence that the total number of comments affects rules. My experimental cases are not included in this prospectus. They will be rules selected by organizations that have agreed to randomly assign specific targets of their mass comment campaigns. While these few cases will not provide necessary power for statistical tests, the responses of the public, elected officials, and rulewriters may help illuminate causal mechanisms.
