title: "Public Pressure Campaigns and Bureaucratic Policymaking"
author: "Devin Judge-Lord"
abstract: | 
  This dissertation is about public pressure campaigns that target U.S. federal agency rulemaking, a technocratic policy process in which participation is usually limited to a few policy insiders. Occasionally, however, public pressure campaigns help make agency rules some of the most hotly contested policies of our time. I examine who organizes public pressure campaigns and why, whether these campaigns affect congressional oversight, and whether they affect policy. Answering these questions informs our understanding of bureaucratic politics as well as interest group lobbying, organizing, and mobilizing tactics. Most comments that federal agencies receive on their draft policies come from ordinary people who were inspired by a public pressure campaign. Yet, leading theories of bureaucratic policymaking neither explain nor account for these fitful bursts of civic engagement. This dissertation develops and tests theories about the roles of individuals, organizations, coalitions, and social movements in bureaucratic policymaking. I show that pressure campaigns build movements, attract policymakers' attention, and systematically counter corporate power by generating information about public demands and the political environment in which policy is made. At the same time, I find that the impact of pressure campaigns is uneven and contingent on the capacity of interest groups to mobilize and of policymakers to process political information. I make four main contributions:
    
    First, I build on scholarship on social movements, interest group behavior, and lobbying to identify three reasons for lobbying organizations to mobilize ordinary people. Each logic suggests a different observable pattern of public engagement, and I analyze millions of public comments on thousands of agency rules to develop the first systematic measures of public engagement in bureaucratic policymaking. I find that most public comments are mobilized by public interest organizations, not by narrow private interests or astroturf campaigns. However, because campaigns require significant organizational capacity and resources, public comment campaigns are dominated by a few large policy advocacy organizations.
    
    Second, building on theories of political oversight, I theorize that mass engagement in bureaucratic policymaking may alert elected officials to political opportunities and risks, thus affecting oversight behaviors. I assess this argument by analyzing correspondence between members of Congress and agency officials on proposed rules with and without mass engagement. I find that public pressure campaigns are correlated with congressional attention and that coalitions with more congressional support are more likely to achieve their policy goals.
    
   Third, I integrate intuitions about outside lobbying and oversight into a broader theory of how public pressure campaigns may affect policy by producing potentially influential political information. I suggest four causal mechanisms by which lobbying may influence policymakers and expand leading formal models of interest group influence in bureaucratic policymaking to account for political information. I then test these models using a mix of hand-coding and computational text analysis methods. I find evidence of indirect effects but little evidence of direct effects of pressure campaigns on policy, especially for public interest campaigns. However, decisions to organize depend on anticipated lobbying success. Private interest groups only lobby when they expect to influence policy, whereas public interest groups also organize campaigns to build power. Thus, my results may understate the impact of public interest campaigns. 
    
   Fourth, I contribute to a growing literature on the effects of social movements through a case study of the environmental justice movement. I show that pressure campaigns are more than a lobbying tactic; they are also an institutionalized form of contentious politics over the distribution of governmental power. I examine the discursive effects of environmental justice claims both qualitatively and quantitatively, including the role of Native American activists and environmental groups in shaping federal policy. I find that agencies frequently ignore environmental justice concerns but are more likely to add language addressing environmental justice in their final rules when public comments and pressure campaigns raise environmental justice concerns. 
    
   I conclude with implications for theories of bureaucratic policymaking and future research and proposed reforms for public participation in policymaking.
