# Introduction


Does civic engagement through public pressure campaigns affect agency rulemaking? I examine who participates in public pressure campaigns and why, whether they affect congressional oversight, and whether they affect policy. Answering these questions informs our understanding of bureaucratic politics and interest group lobbying, organizing, and mobilizing tactics. If ordinary people have a voice in bureaucratic policymaking, I argue, it is through public pressure campaings. Thus, understnding the nature and effects of these campaigns is key to understanding modern democracy.
