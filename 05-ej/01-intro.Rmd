# Introduction

I explore the role of public comments in rulemaking by focusing on their
role in the environmental justice movement. Environmental justice
concerns focus on the unequal access to healthy environments and
protection from harms caused by things like pollution and climate
change. The ways in which agencies consider (or fail to consider) environmental justice
highlights how rulemaking has distributive consequences, how the public
comment process creates temporary political communities, and how claims
raised by activists are addressed.

I examine thousands of rulemaking processes at agencies known to address
environmental justice (EJ) concerns. Tracing the evolution of EJ analysis through several of these rulmaking processes shows that the concept is hotly contested and rarely addressed by agencies in ways that activists find unacceptable. Activist pressure clearly affected how rules address EJ in some cases but failed to have an effect in others. On average, I find that when public comments raise
environmental justice concerns, these concerns are more likely to be
addressed in the final rule and how rules address environmenal justice is more likley to change. The
number of comments mobilized both overall and those by environmental justice advocates and  also both related to success.  While we cannot
infer that agencies addressing environmental justice concerns is caused
by the public comments themselves, comments may be a good proxy for
lobbying and public pressure in general. Furthermore, the correlation between raising
environmental justice and policy changes is largest and most significant
in agencies with missions focused on environmental
policy, i.e. the kinds of bureaucrats who we may expect to have
institutional and cognitive processes primed to be most responsive to
environmental justice concerns.

The environmental justice movement's successes and failures in rulemaking illustrate how activists attempt to use public comments to
inject ideas directly into the rulemaking process. I focus on the
environmental justice movement because it offers a broad but tractable
scope for analysis and shows what is at stake in the politics of
rulemaking. How rules consider environmental justice issues illustrates
how rulemaking constructs a political community of "relevant"
stakeholders and "appropriate" criteria to evaluate policy consequences.
Thus, the idea of environmental justice is an example of how social
movements mobilize norms and evaluative frameworks that are
connected to organizational identities, mission, and reputations and
thus have implications for bureaucratic decisions [@Carpenter2001].

Mobilization around ideas like environmental justice may even affect
policy discourse when agency administrators are explicitly hostile to
the cause. 
Tracing ideas like environmental justice through the rulemaking record offers one way to study the mechanisms by which social movements do
or do not influence bureaucratic policymaking. If rules
are proposed without attention to environmental justice concerns, but
environmental justice concerns are raised in the public comments and
then appear in the final policy, this may be evidence that public pressure mattered. Likewise, when proposed rules do include an EJ analysis, groups comment on it and the agency changes its discussion of EJ in the final rule, this may be evidence that public pressure mattered. 

## "Environmental Justice" as a Boundary-drawing Tool

Environmental justice is certainly not the only way to observe such
effects, but it has some convenient properties. First, discourse around policies framed
as "environmental" issues is, unlike issues like issues like civil
rights and immigration, inconsistently racialized and, unlike issues
like taxes and spending, inconsistently focused on *distributions* of
costs and benefits. Despite almost always having disparate impacts, an
environmental frame often creates a human-environment distinction and
shifts attention to non-human objects such as air, water, food, or
landscapes and away from the distribution of access to these objects or
protection from them when they are contaminated. 


Second, compared to
other ideas around which people mobilize, "environmental justice" is a
fairly distinctive phrase. Most people who use this phrase share a
general definitional foundation. Even attempts to reframe the term (e.g. to focus on class rather than race or jobs rather than health) come about as a dialictical move related to the term's historial uses. Thus, when "environmental justice" appears in a text, it is rearealy a coincidence of words; it's appearence is a result of the movement or reactions to it.

Third, this phrase appears frequently
when the idea is discussed, i.e. there are not many synonyms and
groups raising equity concerns on "environmental" issues commonly refer
to environmental justice. Those who use the narrower, related term
"environmental racism" almost always use "environmental justice" in their
advocacy as well. 


Finally, the term is relevant to rulemaking records in
particular because of Executive Order 12898 issued in 1994 by President
Clinton \"Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority
Populations and Low-Income Populations\" which required all agency
actions and policies to consider environmental justice implications. Executive orders from Presidents Obama and Biden and statements from agency heads in every administration have since interpreted and reinterpreted parts of this order, all with direct implications for rulemaking. 
This does not mean that all draft or final rules address environmental justice, but when they
do, they tend to cite Executive Order 12898 and explicitly discuss
environmental justice. For the same reason, commenters, especially
sophisticated ones, who critique draft rules also use the cite this
executive order and use this language. 

Advocates may even sue agencies for failing to satisfy the proceedural requirements of E.O. 12898, giving agencies an incentive to explain how their policies and justifications address the Executive Order and environmental justice concerns of commenters.
Rules may be struck down by courts for failing to comply with Administrative Proceedures Act (APA) requirements if the issuing agency fails to “examine the relevant data” or “consider an important aspect of the problem" (*Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.*, 1983). This can include an agency's EJ analysis. : "environmental justice analysis can be reviewed under NEPA and the APA” (*Cmtys. Against Runway Expansion, Inc. v. FAA*, 2004).

# Theory

Participatory processes like public comment periods, where government
agencies must solicit public input on draft policies, are said to provide democratic legitimacy [@Croley2003; @Rosenbloom2003], new technical information [@Yackee2006JPART; @Nelson2012], and political oversight opportunities [@Balla1998; @Mccubbins1984]. While recent scholarship on agency policymaking has shed light on sophisticated lobbying by businesses, we know surprisingly little about the vast majority of public comments, which are submitted by ordinary people as part of public pressure campaigns [judgelord2019SPSA].^[
    As shown in judgelord2019SPSA, most comments submitted to
    regulations.gov are part of organized campaigns, more akin to petition signatures than "deliberative" participation or sophisticated lobbying. Indeed, approximately 40 million out of
    50 million (80%) of these public comments on rulemaking dockets between 2004 and 2019 were mobilized by just 100
    advocacy organizations. ]
Activists frequently target agency policymaking with letter-writing campaigns, petitions, protests,
and mobilizing people to attend hearings, all classic examples of "civic engagement" [@Verba1987]. Yet civic engagement remains poorly understood in the context of bureaucratic policymaking.
While practitioners and administrative law scholars have long pondered
what to make of mass comment campaigns, political scientists have had
surprisingly little to say about this kind of civic participation. 

## Technical information as the currency of lobbying

Dominant theories of bureaucratic policymaking focus on how agencies learn about policy problems (@Kerwin2011). Leading formal models are information-based models where comments matter by revealing information to the agency [@Gailmard2017, @Libgober2018] and empiral studies support the conclusoin that information is the currency of lobbying in rulemaking [@Yackee2012, @Cook2017, @Gordon2018, @Walters2019].  

Rulemaking is a highly techoratic and legalistic for of policymaking that explicitly privleges scientific and legal information as appropriate basis for decisions.  Proceedural requirements to consider relevent information create incentives for lobbying groups to overwhelm agencies with complex techincal information, making rulmaking obscure to all but the most well-informed insiders [@Wagner2010]. Empirical work shows 
wagner
yackee

The result is that rulemaking is dominated by sophisticated and well-resourced interest groups capable of providing new technical or legal information. Empirical scholarship finds that economic elites and business groups
dominate American politics in general [@Jacobs2005,@Soss2007, Hertel-Fernandez2019, @Hacker2003, @Gilens2014] and rulemaking in
particular. While some are optimistic that requirements for agencies to
solicit and respond to public comments on proposed rules allow "civil
society" to provide public oversight [@Michaels2015; @Metzger2010], most
studies find that participants in rulemaking often represent elites and
business interests [@Seifter2016UCLA; @Crow2015; @Wagner2011; @West2009; @Yackee2006JOP; @Yackee2006JPART; @Golden1998; @Haeder2015; @Cook2017, LibgoberCarpenter2018].



## Public pressure is assumed to have little role in rulemaking

To the extent that scholars address public pressure campaigns, both
existing theory and empirical scholarship suggest skepticism that it
matters. 


## Political information

@Nelson2012
identify political information as a potentially influential result of
lobbying by different business coalitions. While they focus on
mobilizing experts, @Nelson2012 describe a dynamic that can be extended
to mobilizing public pressure:

> "strategic recruitment, we theorize, mobilizes new actors to
> participate in the policymaking process, bringing with them novel
> technical and political information. In other words, when an expanded
> strategy is employed, leaders activate individuals and organizations
> to participate in the policymaking process who, without the
> coordinating efforts of the leaders, would otherwise not lobby. This
> activation is important because it implies that coalition lobbying can
> generate new information and new actors---beyond simply the 'usual
> suspects'---relevant to policy decisionmakers."

I argue that, concerning political information, this logic extends to
non-experts in at least two ways. 

### 1. Information about a policy's disporate effects

First, while specific *data* on disporate impacts of policy may require expertise, anyone can highlight a community of concern and potential distributional effects of policy. Just as @Nelson2012 found regarding the mobilizing of diverse experts, mobilizing diverse communities that may be affected by a policy may introduce new claims from new actors about who how the communities benefited or harmed by a poicy should be constructed. Instead of bolstering
*scientific* claims, perceived public support bolsters *political*
claims about who counts and even who exists as a potentially affected group.  While bureaucratic policymaking in the United States is dominated by cost-benefit analysis that must abstract away from the distribution of costs and benifits, agencies have many reasons to consider the distributional effects of policy and often do.


### 2. Public pressure as a political resource

Second, The number of supporters may
matter because it indicates support among relevant communities or the broader public. Again, instead of bolstering
*scientific* claims, perceived public support bolsters *political*
claims. 

Like other forms of political participation, such as protests and letter writing campaigns, 
public pressure campaigns provide no new technical information. <!--%In this sense, they are not useful. -->
Nor do they wield any formal authority to reward or sanction bureaucrats.
The number on each side, be it ten or ten million, has no legal import for an agency's response.

An organization's ability to expand the scope of conflict by mobilizing
a large number of people can, however, be a valuable political resource [@Schattschneider1975]. @Furlong1997 and @Kerwin2011
identify mobilization as a tactic. The organizations that they surveyed
reported that forming coalitions and mobilizing large numbers of people
are among the most effective lobbying tactics. While @Furlong1997 and @Kerwin2011 focused on how
organizations mobilize their membership, I expand on this understanding of mobilization as a lobbying tactic to include a campaign's broader audience, more akin to the concept of
an attentive public [@Key1961] or issue public [@Converse1964]. 


Regardless of the specific claims of commenters, expanding the scope of conflict by mobilizing public attention to rulemaking may shift policymakers attention away from the techical information usual suspects and tward the distributive effects of policy.

## Hypotheses

The existing literature on bureurcratic policymaking in general and environmental justice advocacy in particular presents competiting intuitions about the effect of environmental justice advocates and the broader public in rulemaking. Below, I posit hypotheses that in the direction that these advocacy groups do affect rulemaking while also noting equally plasuable intuitions for the opposite conclusions. Because of the general skepticism end empirical work to date finding that advocacy groups and public pressure campaigns have little to no effect on rulemaking, I set the empirical bar low: do environmental justice advocates and public pressure campaigns have *any* effect at all on policy documents. 

### Information 

> *Distributive Information Hypothesis*: Policymakers are more likley to change whether or how policies address environmental justice when commentrs raise environmental justice concerns.

As discussed above, agency policymakers have incentives to address distributive concerns, especially environmental justice due to judicial review of compliance with the Adminstrative Proceedures Act and E.O.12898. By raising environmental justice concerns, commenters draw attention to the distribution of policy impacts. 


> *Repeated Information Hypothesis*: Policymakers are more likley to change whether or how policies address environmental justice when more commentors raise environmetnal justice concerns.

Scholarship on lobbying in rulmaking emphasises the value of repeated information and coalition size [@Nelson2012]. This implies that 

Competing intuitions and other prior studies oppose the *Distributive Information Hypothesis*. Scholarship on lobbying in rulemaking emphasises the importance of novel science, technical information, and other things unknown to agency experts. This scholarship has finds buisness commentors are influential and public interest groups are not [@Yackee2006JOP, @Haeder2015]. Furthermore, policymakers may be more likley to anticipate EJ concerns when they are more salient to interest groups and the public and thus. This would mean that rules where commenters EJ concerns may be *the least* likely to change whether or how EJ is addressed because policymakers are more likley to have considered the issues and stated their final position in the draft rule. 

> *Policy Receptivity Hypothesis*: Agencies that more frequently conduct environmental analysis will be more responsive to commenters raising environmental justice concerns.

Bureaucracies are specialized institutions built for making and implimenting certian kinds of policies based on certain goals and facts. The distinct norms and epistimic community commeunity determine whether issues are seen as "environmental" and having disporate impacts meriting a consideration of distributive "justice." Some poicymakers may see their policy area as more related environmetnal justice than others and thus be more receptive to commenter concerns. 

The competing intuition to the *Policy Receptivty Hypothsis is that policymakers familiar with environmetnal justice concerns are the least likelty to be responsive to EJ concerns becasue these concerns are anticipated and not novel. If so, agencies with that think about EJ may be more easily influenced to do so by commenters who present somewhat novel information and concerns. These agencies may be less likley to have prempted critques.

### Public Pressure 

> *General Pressure Hypothesis*: Rules are more likley to change when they recieve more comments.

@Furlong1997 and @Kerwin2011

The 

> *Specific pressure hypothesis*:  Agencies are more likley to change whether or how they address environmenantal justice when they recieve more comments *and* some comments raise environmental justice concerns.

It is possible that the effect 

The competing intuition is again that large numbers of comments indicate high-salience rulemakings where the agency anticipates public scrutenty, including on environmental how it did or did not address environmetnal justice and is more likley to have stated its final position in the final rule. 



# Methods


The cases I trace are not selected as the most similar, most differet, or a represenative sample. They emerged from soaking and poking in the text of rule making records. Their purporse is to assess whether the cases in the quantative analysis are plausabley what they appear to be: that changes in rule text are, sometimes, causally related to public comments and that non-changes are cases of agencies disregarding comments, not some accident of the data or measures. Tracing a somewhat random rulemaking processes also helped to avoid analitic pitfalls. For example, one case where an agency did an EJ anslysis and then appeared not to respond to a comment discussing EJ was in fact due to the fact that the commentor included an annotated version of the draft rule their comment, adding only "no comment' next to the 12898 section. To correct this, I removed text coppied from the proposed rule from comments in pre-processing. The qualitative reading also confirmed other key assumptions such as the fact that advocates do in fact use "environmental justice" when they raise distributional concerns, even on many rules that are not about issues traditioanlly considered "environmental" because of its power to give distributional justice claims gain legal purchase.
