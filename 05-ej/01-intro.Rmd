# Introduction

I explore the role of public comments in rulemaking by focusing on their
role in the environmental justice movement. Environmental justice
concerns focus on the unequal access to healthy environments and
protection from harms caused by things like pollution and climate
change. The ways in which agencies consider environmental justice
highlights how rulemaking has distributive consequences, how the public
comment process creates temporary political communities, and how claims
raised by activists are addressed.

Examining thousands of rulemaking processes at agencies known to address
environmental justice concerns, I find that when public comments raise
environmental justice concerns, these concerns are more likely to be
addressed in the final rule. In this preliminary analysis, however, the
number of comments mobilized is not related to success. While we cannot
infer that agencies addressing environmental justice concerns is caused
by the public comments themselves, comments may be a good proxy for
lobbying in general. Furthermore, the correlation between raising
environmental justice and policy changes is largest and most significant
in agencies with missions focused on environmental and distributional
policy, i.e. the kinds of bureaucrats who we may expect to have
institutional and cognitive processes primed to be most responsive to
environmental justice concerns.

This case illustrates the way that activists use public comments to
inject ideas directly into the rulemaking process. I focus on the
environmental justice movement because it offers a broad but tractable
scope for analysis and shows what is at stake in the politics of
rulemaking. How rules consider environmental justice issues illustrates
how rulemaking constructs a political community of "relevant"
stakeholders and "appropriate" criteria to evaluate policy consequences.
Thus, the idea of environmental justice is an example of how social
movements can mobilize norms and evaluative frameworks that are
connected to organizational identities, mission, and reputations and
that have implications for bureaucratic decisions.

The use of an environmental justice frame does not always imply the same
communities of concern. Environmental justice emerged out of movements
against environmental racism, especially the disposal of toxic
substances in communities of color [@Bullard1993]. However, the term
quickly took on a wider array of meanings, encompassing any marginalized
group. In 1994 the Bill Clinton signed an Executive order on
Environmental Justice that required all parts of the federal government
to make "addressing disproportionately high and adverse human health or
environmental effects of programs, policies, and activities on minority
populations and low-income populations" a core aspect of their mission.
This meant considering disproportionate effects during rulemaking.

Fundamental definitions of the public good and minority rights are
implicit in agency rules. The public comment process offers an
opportunity to protest these definitions. Protest is one way that
marginalized groups can communicate opinions on issues to government
officials [@Gillion2013]. In the case of the EPA's Mercury Rules, two
such issues were decisive. First, as with many forms of pollution,
mercury-emitting power plants are concentrated in low-income, often
non-White communities. Second, certain populations consume much more
locally-caught freshwater fish, a major vector of Mercury toxicity.
Studies inspired by the political controversy around the Mercury Rules
found high risk among communities included "Hispanic, Vietnamese, and
Laotian populations in California and Great Lakes tribal populations
(Chippewa and Ojibwe) active on ceded territories around the Great
Lakes" (EPA 2012). Thus the standards that EPA chooses are fundamentally
dependent on whom the regulation aims to protect: the average citizen,
local residents, or fishing communities. This decision has disparate
effects based on race and class because of disparate effects based on
geography and different cultural practices. Such disparate impacts are
often called environmental justice issues.

In December 2000, when the EPA first announced its intention to regulate
Mercury from power plants, the notice published in the Federal Register
did not address environmental justice issues such as the disparate
effects of mercury on certain populations. Risks were only discussed in
reference to "the U.S. population" (EPA 2000). When the first draft rule
was published, it only discussed the effects of the rule on regulated
entities, noting that "Other types of entities not listed could also be
affected" (EPA 2002). Commenting on this draft, Heather McCausland of
the Alaska Community Action on Toxics (ACAT) wrote:

> "The amount of methyl-mercury and other bioaccumulative chemicals

> much higher than is assumed\...The Alaska Native mortality rate for

> Global transport & old military sites contaminate us too"

After receiving hundreds of thousands of comments and pressure from
tribal organizations, a revised proposed rule echoed McCausland's
comment noting that "Some subpopulations in the U.S., such as Native
Americans, Southeast Asian Americans, and lower-income subsistence
fishers, may rely on fish as a primary source of nutrition and/or for
cultural practices. Therefore, they consume larger amounts of fish than
the general population and may be at a greater risk of the adverse
health effects from Hg due to increased exposure" (EPA 2004).

After nearly a million additional public comments, a revised proposed
rule ultimately included five pages of analysis of the disparate impacts
on \"vulnerable populations\" including "African Americans," "Hispanic,"
"Native American," and "Other and Multi-racial" groups (EPA 2011). In
the final rule, the language of "vulnerable populations " was replaced
with "minority, low income, and indigenous populations" (EPA 2012). EPA
had also conducted an analysis of sub-populations with particularly high
potential risks exposure due to high rates of fish consumption as well
as an additional analysis of the distribution of mortality risk by to
race.

Of this second round of comments, over 200 explicitly raised the
environmental justice issues. The Little River Band of Ottawa Indians
expressed the Tribe's "frustration at trying to impress upon the EPA the
multiple and profound impacts of mercury contamination from a Tribal
perspective. Not to mention the obligations under treaties to
participate with tribes on a "Government to Government" basis. At
present, no such meetings have occurred in any meaningful manner with
EPA Region V, the EPA National American Indian Environmental Office, nor
the State of Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality." They
conclude that \"Although EPA purported to consider environmental justice
as it developed its "Clean Air Mercury Rule," it failed utterly. In this
rulemaking, EPA perpetuated, rather than ameliorated, a long history of
cultural discrimination against tribes and their members" (Sprague
2011). Did comments like these play a role in EPA's changed analysis of
who Mercury limits should aim to protect?

Given the many potential sources of influence, it may be difficult to
attribute causal effects of particular comments on a given policy.
However, comments may serve as a good proxy for the general mobilization
of groups and individuals around an administrative process, and it is
not clear why EPA would not address environmental justice in the first
draft of a rule and then add it to subsequent drafts in the absence of
activists mobilization. Electoral politics does not offer an easy
explanation. The notice proposing the Mercury Rule was issued by the
Clinton administration, the same administration that issued the
Executive Order on Environmental Justice, and the subsequent drafts that
did address environmental justice issues were published by the Bush
administration, which had a more contentious relationship with
environmental justice advocates, while Republicans controlled both
houses of Congress. The expansion of the analysis from one draft to the
next seems to be in response to activist pressure.

Mobilization around ideas like environmental justice may even affect
policy discourse when agency administrators are explicitly hostile to
the cause. For example, in an October 2017 proposed rule to repeal
restrictions on power plant pollution, the Trump EPA acknowledges that
"low-income and minority communities located in proximity to [power
plants] may have experienced an improvement in air quality as a result
of the emissions reductions." Because the Executive Order requires
attention to environmental justice and because the Obama EPA discussed
it when promulgating the rule, the environmental justice cannot safely
be ignored. However, the Trump EPA contends, the Obama EPA "did not
address lower household energy bills for low-income households [and
that] workers losing jobs in regions or occupations with weak labor
markets would have been most vulnerable" (EPA 2017). As of , this
proposed rule has received over 150,000 public comments.

Tracing ideas like environmental justice through the rulemaking record
may offer one way to study the mechanisms by which social movements do
or do not influence bureaucratic policymaking. Specifically, if rules
are proposed without attention to environmental justice concerns, but
environmental justice concerns are raised in the public comments and
then appear in the final policy, this may be evidence that mobilization
mattered.

Environmental justice is certainly not the only way to observe such
effects, but it has some convenient properties. First, policies framed
as "environmental" issues are, unlike issues like issues like civil
rights and immigration, inconsistently racialized and, unlike issues
like taxes and spending, inconsistently focus on *distributions* of
costs and benefits. Despite almost always having disparate impacts, an
environmental frame often creates a human-environment distinction and
shifts attention to non-human objects such as air, water, food, or
landscapes and away from the distribution of access to these objects or
protection from them when they are contaminated. Second, compared to
other ideas around which people mobilize, "environmental justice" is a
fairly distinctive phrase. Most people who use this phrase share a
general definitional foundation. Third, this phrase is fairly common
when the idea is being discussed, i.e. there are not many synonyms and
groups raising equity concerns on "environmental" issues commonly refer
to environmental justice. Many who use the narrower, related term
"environmental racism" also use "environmental justice" in their
advocacy. Finally, the term is relevant to rulemaking records in
particular because of an Executive Order issued in 1994 by President
Clinton \"Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority
Populations and Low-Income Populations\" which required all agency
actions and policies to consider environmental justice implications.
This does not mean that all draft or final rules do so, but when they
do, they tend to cite the executive order and explicitly discuss
environmental justice. For the same reason, commenters, especially
sophisticated ones, who critique draft rules also use the cite this
executive order and use this language.
