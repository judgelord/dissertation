## Introduction

Social movements like the civil rights movement and the environmental movement are understood to have played a critical role in advancing landmark statutes recognizing new rights and social values. Likewise, a lack of movement pressure is a leading explanation for the failure of policy efforts to address issues like climate change [@Skocpol2013]. Yet, we have little systematic evidence about the impact of social movements on modern policymaking. To what extent do movements shape the thousands of policies the government makes every year? I examine how social movements affect policymaking by assessing the environmental justice movement's impact on 25 thousand policy processes in 40 U.S. federal agencies from 1993 to 2020. Environmental justice concerns focus on unequal access to healthy environments and protection from harms caused by things like pollution and climate change [@Bullard1993].  The environmental justice movement illustrates how activists attempt to inject ideas directly into the policymaking process. Systematic data on how policy documents address (or fail to address) environmental justice allow empirical tests of theories about when institutions will address claims raised by activists.

I focus on the environmental justice movement because it offers a broad but tractable
scope for analysis and illuminates what is at stake in the politics of
agency policymaking. Policies have distributive consequences. How policy documents address distributive issues highlights how policy processes construct communities of "relevant" stakeholders and "appropriate" criteria to evaluate policy consequences.
Raising environmental justice concerns in policy debates is an example of how social movement organizations mobilize norms and evaluative frameworks that interact with organizational identities, mission, and reputations and, thus, impact policy decisions [@Carpenter2001].

Tracing ideas like environmental justice (EJ) through policy processes reveals the mechanisms by which social movements succeed or fail to influence policy. If draft policies do not mention EJ concerns, but activists raise EJ concerns and policymakers then address in the final policy, this may be evidence that public pressure mattered. Likewise, when draft policies *do* address EJ, if groups comment on it and then policymakers change how the final policy addresses EJ, this may be evidence that public pressure mattered. 

I assess the impact of the EJ movement qualitatively and quantitatively. Tracing the evolution of EJ analyses through several policy processes shows that the concept is hotly contested and rarely addressed by agencies in ways that activists find acceptable. Activist pressure affected how policies addressed EJ in some cases but failed to affect other policies. 

Examining all rules published by 40 agencies to regulations.gov between 1993 and 2020, I find that activist mobilization affected policy discourse, even under administrations that were explicitly hostile to their cause. When public comments raise EJ concerns, these concerns are more likely to be addressed in policy documents. Specifically, the number of comments mobilized (both overall and by EJ advocates specifically) is positively correlated with agencies adding language addressing EJ to policies where the draft policy did not mention EJ. When comments raise EJ concerns, sections of policies that do address EJ are also more likely to change.
Furthermore, the correlation between EJ activist mobilization and policy changes is largest for agencies with missions focused on "environmental" and distributive policy---the kinds of policymakers we may expect to have institutional and cognitive processes primed to be most responsive to EJ concerns.


## Theory

Participatory processes like public comment periods, where policymakers must solicit public input on draft policies, are said to provide democratic legitimacy [@Croley2003; @Rosenbloom2003], new technical information [@Yackee2006JPART; @Nelson2012], and political oversight opportunities [@Balla1998; @McCubbins1984]. While recent scholarship on agency policymaking has shed light on sophisticated lobbying by businesses, we know surprisingly little about the vast majority of public comments on proposed agency rules, which are submitted as part of public pressure campaigns.^[
    As shown in @judgelord2019SPSA, most comments submitted to
    regulations.gov are part of organized campaigns, more akin to petition signatures than "deliberative" participation or sophisticated lobbying. Indeed, approximately 40 million out of
    50 million (80%) of these public comments on rulemaking dockets between 2004 and 2019 were mobilized by just 100
    advocacy organizations. ]
Activists frequently target agency policymaking with letter-writing campaigns, petitions, protests,
and mobilizing people to attend hearings, all classic examples of "civic engagement" [@Verba1987]. Yet civic engagement remains poorly understood in the context of bureaucratic policymaking.
While practitioners and administrative law scholars have long pondered
what to make of activists' mass comment campaigns, political scientists have had
surprisingly little to say about this kind of civic participation. 

### Social Movements and Policy Change

Social movement pressure is a major driver of policy change (Dahl 1956; Piven & Cloward 1977; Lipsky 1968; Tarrow 1994; Andrews 1997; McAdam 1982, 2001; McAdam & Su 2002, McCammon et al. 2011; Cress & Snow 2000; Weldon 2002). 
This is especially true for policies that redistribute wealth or other social privileges. "From the very beginning, redistributive policies have been associated with social classes and social movements" [@Lowi2015]. The organizational forms that mobilize and channel movement pressure (often called social movement organizations by those who study their organization and advocacy organizations or pressure groups by those who study their effects) are essential features of modern politics and lawmaking [@Baumgartner2001; @Coglianese2001]. Conversely, the lack of broad-based support for and movement pressure can be the failure of a policy effort [@Skocpol2013].

Scholars have also shown the effect of specific pressure tactics. For example, protests affect policy [@Gillion2013].  Activists reshape political parties to enact new policy agendas [@Schattschneider1942; @Cohen2008; @Schlozman2015; @Skocpol2016]. Petition campaigns, in particular, can both build the organizational capacity and political coalitions required to to affect policy and place issues on national agendas. As @CarpenterPetitions finds, both of Indigenous governments and activists have long used opportunities to build coalitions and raise concerns to the fedral goverment: 

> Because they assisted in recruiting tribal communities and allies to Indigenous causes,  these petitioning moments enhanced organizational democracy. They also advanced procedural democracy by effectively placing Indigenous issues on local, ecclesiastical, tribal, state, and national agendas." [@CarpenterPetitions, pg. 119] 

Still, most studies of social movements tend to explain social movement emergence rather than specific impacts (see reviews by @Meyer2004 and @Mcadam2017). Reviews of the social movement literature find "limited research on [social movement] influence" [@Andrews2004].

Studies that do focus on policy influence tend to focus on landmark policies like the Civil Rights Act [@Gillion2013] or case studies of local policy issues [e.g., @Bullard1993; @Rochon1993]. Reviewing the specificity of measures used to assess the impact of advocacy campaigns, @Burstein2020 concludes that "In contrast to those studying opinion and policy, however, researchers studying advocacy and policy rarely discuss levels of specificity." In addition to measures of advocacy and influence, there are issues with case selection. @Leech2010 argues that the influence of advocacy campaigns is overstated because scholars focus on issues where impact is especially likely--issues characterized by a lot of advocacy and recent or impending policy change. @Lowery2013 voices the opposite concern, that high-salience issues that scholars select are the cases least likely to observe advocacy success. In short, studies often select cases on the dependent variable. While large-scale and longitudinal studies have become more common [@Hojnacki2012], the dependent variable is rarely systematic impact across the thousands of non-landmark policies that governments make every year. 

To address this gap, I focus on systematic impacts on specific policy documents over time. Specifically, I assess the impact of the environmental justice movement on bureaucratic policymaking. 

### Technical Information: the Currency of Lobbying

Dominant theories of bureaucratic policymaking have little room for social movements and political pressure. Instead, they focus on how agencies learn about policy problems and solutions [@Kerwin2011]. Leading formal models are information-based models where sophisticated lobbying groups affect policy by revealing information to the agency [@Gailmard2017;@Libgober2018], and empirical studies support the conclusion that information is the currency of lobbying in rulemaking [@Yackee2012;@Cook2017;@Gordon2018;@Walters2019].  

Agency rulemaking is an especially technocratic and legalistic form of policymaking that explicitly privileges scientific and legal facts as the appropriate basis for decisions.  Procedural requirements to consider relevant information create incentives for lobbying groups to overwhelm agencies with complex technical information, making rulemaking obscure to all but the most well-informed insiders [@Wagner2010]. <!--Empirical work shows yackee -->
As @Yackee2019 notes:

> "to be influential during rulemaking,
commenters may require resources and technical expertise.
> As Epstein, Heidt, and Farina (2014) suggest, agency rule-writers--who are often chosen because
of their technical or policy-specific expertise--privilege the type of data-driven
arguments and reasoning that are not common to citizen comments." (p. 10)

The result is that rulemaking is dominated by sophisticated and well-resourced interest groups capable of providing new technical or legal information. Empirical scholarship finds that economic elites and business groups
dominate American politics in general [@Jacobs2005; @Soss2007; @Hertel-Fernandez2019; @Hacker2003; @Gilens2014] and rulemaking in
particular. While some are optimistic that requirements for agencies to
solicit and respond to public comments on proposed rules allow "civil
society" to provide public oversight [@Michaels2015; @Metzger2010], most
studies find that participants in rulemaking often represent elites and
business interests [@Seifter2016UCLA; @Crow2015; @Wagner2011; @West2009; @Yackee2006JOP; @Yackee2006JPART; @Golden1998; @Haeder2015; @Cook2017; @LibgoberCarpenter2018]. To the extent that scholars address public pressure campaigns, both
existing theory and empirical scholarship suggest skepticism that it
matters. For example, @Balla2018 find that  "legal imperatives trump political considerations." <!--TODO @Balla2018 find that....-->

### Political Information

While social movement organizations do engage in fights over technical reports and scientific studies, the information that activists provide is often more overtly political. 
@Nelson2012
identify political information as a potentially influential result of
groups expanding their lobbying coalition. While they focus on
mobilizing experts, @Nelson2012 describe a dynamic that can be extended
to mobilizing public pressure:

> "strategic recruitment, we theorize, mobilizes new actors to
> participate in the policymaking process, bringing with them novel
> technical and political information. In other words, when an expanded
> strategy is employed, leaders activate individuals and organizations
> to participate in the policymaking process who, without the
> coordinating efforts of the leaders, would otherwise not lobby. This
> activation is important because it implies that coalition lobbying can
> generate new information and new actors---beyond simply the 'usual
> suspects' ---relevant to policy decisionmakers."

I argue that, concerning political information, this logic extends to
non-experts in at least two ways. First, mobilizing new actors to participate in the policymaking process may yield information about a policy's disparate effects. Second, levels of public pressure can be a political resource, allowing groups to change policymakers' perceptions of their political environment and the political consequences of their decisions. 

#### Information About a Policy's Disparate Effects

First, while specific *data* on disparate impacts of policy may require expertise, anyone can highlight a community of concern or potential distributive effects of a policy. Just as @Nelson2012 found regarding the mobilizing of diverse experts, mobilizing diverse communities affected by a policy may introduce new claims from new actors about how the communities that a policy may benefit or harm should be constructed. Indeed, telling a policymaker how a particular set of stakeholders will be affected or what they think is a lobbying tactic. Instead of bolstering *scientific* claims, such comments focusing on a policy's disparate impacts bolster *political* claims about who counts and even *who exists* as a distinct, potentially affected group that deserves policymakers' attention. 

The political construction of policy-relevant groups through the policy process has long interested administrative law scholars. @Gellhorn1972 argues that "individuals and groups willing to assist administrative agencies in identifying interests deserving protection" (p. 403) improve the policy process. @Seifter2016UCLA argues that policymaker's beliefs about who is lobbying them and who those groups represent ought to be (and likely is) key to how they respond. 

<!-- lowi politics -->
The politics and outcomes of policymaking depend on how the relevant groups are defined [@Lowi1964].  <!--TODO-->
<!-- institutions feinstein -->
The power of groups to affect policy depends on their recognition by formal and informal institutions. 
Public comment periods in agency rulemaking are formally more "identity neutral" than policy processes with procedural rights reserved for certain interests [@Feinstein2021]. This means that the political construction of relevant groups depends on who participates and the identities they mobilize or claim to represent. As @Yackee2019 and others note, the information costs mean that individuals rarely participate. Instead, groups claim to represent various constituencies. "Because the costs of individualized participation in policy decision making are often excessive, informal representatives are prevalent as a form of participation in agency decisions" [@Rossi1997, pg. 194].




<!--CBA-->
Bureaucratic policymaking in the United States is dominated by cost-benefit analysis, which requires defining groups that are benefited or harmed by a policy and may even weigh or prioritize benefits or costs to certain groups. Agencies have many reasons to consider the distributional effects of policy and often do. For example, president Biden issued a memorandum instructing the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to propose recommendations for "procedures that take into account the distributional consequences of regulations." <!--[CITE https://www.theregreview.org/2021/04/26/adler-factoring-equity-benefit-cost-analysis/]-->
Thus, comments raising distributive concerns provide potentially influential political information.

This distributive information raises claims of distributive justice. 
Public comment periods are celebrated as "a crucial way to ensure that agency decisions are legitimate, accountable, and just" [@Bierschbach2012]. "Public participation can force agencies to rethink initial inclinations" [@Seifter2016UCLA]---for example, which social groups are relevant or deserve special attention.
Courts purportedly review policy decisions made through rulemaking with a particular eye toward whether they foster "fairness and deliberation" (*United States v. Mead Corp.*, 533 U.S. 218 2001), though empirical evidence suggests skepticism about the importance of policy processes for judicial review [@judgelord2016MPSA].


#### Public pressure as a political resource

Second, the number of supporters may
matter because it indicates support among relevant communities or the broader public. Again, instead of bolstering *scientific* claims, perceived levels of public support bolster *political* claims. 

Like other forms of political participation, such as protests and letter-writing campaigns, 
public pressure campaigns provide no new technical information. <!--%In this sense, they are not useful. -->
Nor do they wield any formal authority to reward or sanction bureaucrats.
The number on each side, be it ten or ten million, has no legal import for an agency's response.

However, an organization's ability to expand the scope of conflict by mobilizing
a large number of people can be a valuable political resource [@Schattschneider1975]. @Furlong1997 and @Kerwin2011
identify mobilization as a tactic. The organizations they surveyed
believed that forming coalitions and mobilizing large numbers of people
were among the most effective lobbying tactics. While @Furlong1997 and @Kerwin2011 focused on how
organizations mobilize their members, I expand on this understanding of mobilization as a lobbying tactic to include a campaign's broader audience, more akin to the concept of
an attentive public [@Key1961] or issue public [@Converse1964]. 

While scholars have generally distinguished the participation of groups from individual citizens (see @Yackee2019 for a review), "it can be difficult to distinguish an individual's independent contribution from an interest-group-generated form letter" [@Seifter2016UCLA, pg. 1313]. I argue that we should view the participation of individuals as a direct result of interest group mobilization. As [@Rossi1997, pg. 194] argues, "individuals are most likely to participate in agency decisions
by virtue of their membership in interest groups." Indeed, nearly all individual comments on proposed policies are mobilized by interest groups [@judgelord2019SPSA]. The small number of unaffiliated individuals, disconnected from any organized lobbying effort, can be safely ignored empirically. <!--Indeed, efforts to broaden citizen participation that seek *unmediated* participation are likely infeasible.--> Interest groups are the unit of analysis, and individual participants are best understood as measuring an amplitude of support for their efforts.

Because many politically active groups are "memberless" or run by professionals who lobby with little input from their members [@Baumgartner2001; @Skocpol2003; @Schlozman2012], evidence of an actual constituency is valuable political information. Petition signatures and form letters are among the only ways that a pressure group can demonstrate an engaged and issue-specific constituency on whose behalf they claim to advocate. While lobbying disclosure requirements could provide other information about how well groups represent the constituencies they claim to represent [@Seifter2016UCLA], letter-writing campaigns are one of the only strategies currently available to demonstrate issue-specific congruence between the positions of groups and the people they claim to represent [@judgelord2019SPSA]. 

Finally, expanding the scope of conflict by mobilizing public attention to rulemaking may shift policymakers' attention away from the technical information provided by the "usual suspects" and toward the distributive effects of policy. The "fire alarm" role that interest groups play in the policy process [@McCubbins1984] may have different effects when sounding the alarm also involves "going public" [@judgelord2019SPSA]. 

### Hypotheses

The existing literature on bureaucratic policymaking in general---and EJ advocacy in particular---presents competing intuitions about the effect of EJ activists and the broader public in rulemaking. From the above discussion political information, I distill five hypotheses ---three about distributive information and two about public pressure. I posit hypotheses in the direction that these advocacy groups do affect rulemaking while also noting equally plausible intuitions for the opposite conclusions. Because of the general skepticism and empirical work that has found that advocacy groups and public pressure campaigns have little to no effect on rulemaking, I set the empirical bar low: do EJ advocates and public pressure campaigns have *any* effect at all on policy documents. 

#### Distributive Information Hypotheses

> *Distributive Information Hypothesis*: Policymakers are more likely to change whether or how policies address distributive justice when commenters raise distributive justice concerns.

As discussed above, agency policymakers have incentives to address distributive concerns, especially environmental justice, due to E.O. 12898 and judicial review of compliance with the Administrative Procedures Act. By raising EJ concerns, commenters draw attention to the distribution of policy impacts---who a policy may affect. Asserting definitions and categories of stakeholders and affected groups is one type of policy-relevant information.

> *Repeated Information Hypothesis*: Policymakers are more likely to change whether or how policies address concerns when more commenters raise them.

Scholarship on lobbying in rulemaking emphasizes the value of repeated information and coalition size [@Mendelson2011; @Nelson2012]. This implies that the more unique comments raise EJ concerns, the more likely the coalition will influence policy.^[I distinguish unique comments from mass comments. The number of unique comments approximates a coalition's size regarding the number of different groups, each submitting a unique text. The total number of comments, including signatures on identical form letters, indicates public attention and pressure.]

Competing intuitions and other prior studies oppose both the *Distributive and Repeated Information Hypotheses*. Formal models and empirical scholarship on lobbying in rulemaking emphasize the importance of novel science and technical information---things unknown to agency experts [@Wagner2010]. Furthermore, scholarship finds business commenters are influential, and public interest groups are not [@Yackee2006JOP; @Haeder2015]. Furthermore, policymakers may be more likely to anticipate EJ concerns when they are more salient to interest groups. This would mean that rules where commenters raise EJ concerns may be the *least* likely to change whether or how EJ is addressed because policymakers are more likely to have already considered these issues and stated their final position in the draft rule. 

> *Policy Receptivity Hypothesis*: Policymakers that more frequently address concerns like environmental justice will be more responsive to commenters raising those concerns. <!--CITE-->

Bureaucracies are specialized institutions built to make and implement certain kinds of policies based on certain goals and types of facts. Each agency's distinct norms and epistemic community determine whether policymakers see issues as "environmental" and whether they have disparate impacts that demand consideration of distributive "justice." Some policymakers may see their policy area as more related to environmental justice than others and thus be more receptive to commenter concerns. 

The competing intuition to the *Policy Receptivity Hypothesis* is that policymakers familiar with EJ concerns are the *least* likely to respond to EJ concerns because they anticipate these concerns---they are not novel to them. If so, agencies that rarely consider EJ may be more easily influenced by commenters who present somewhat novel information and concerns. These policymakers may be less likely to have preempted EJ critiques in the draft policy.

#### Public Pressure Hypotheses

> *General Pressure Hypothesis*: Policies are more likely to change when they receive more public attention (e.g., more public comments).

<!--TODO-->
If policymakers respond to public pressure, policy should be more likely to change when more people comment on a draft policy. This follows the intuition that policy is most likely to move in high-salience policy processes [@Leech2010].

The competing intuition against the *General Pressure Hypothesis* is again that large numbers of comments indicate policy processes that were already salient before the public pressure campaign. Policymakers anticipate public scrutiny and are thus more likely to have stated their final position in the draft policy.  If this is the case, policies with more public comments should be *less* likely to change. Public attention could also be unrelated to policy change, meaning that policymakers are neither anticipating nor responding to public attention in writing or revising policy documents.

> *Specific Pressure Hypothesis*:  Policies are more likely to address an issue when they receive more public attention (e.g., more public comments) *and* at least one comment raises that issue.

This hypothesis asserts that the overall level of public attention will condition policy responses to specific claims--it is the interaction between the number of total public comments and at least one of those comments raising EJ concerns that makes policy more likely to address EJ. 

The competing intuition against the *Specific Pressure Hypothesis* is again that large numbers of comments indicate high-salience rulemakings where policymakers are more likely to anticipate public scrutiny, including how they did or did not address specific issues like environmental justice. If policymakers anticipate public scrutiny, they may be more likely to preempt EJ concerns and state their final position in the draft policy.
