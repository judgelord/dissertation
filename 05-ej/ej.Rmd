\centerline{\textbf{\underline{NOTE TO READER}}}
The following chapter is part of a dissertation exploring the effects of public pressure on agency rulemaking, a technocratic policy process where "public participation" is usually limited to sophisticated lobbying but occasionally includes millions of people mobilized by public pressure campaigns. Public comment periods on proposed policies purport to provide democratic accountability. Yet theories of bureaucratic policymaking largely ignore the occasional bursts of civic engagement that generate the vast majority of public comments on proposed rules. To fill this gap, I build and test theories about the role of public pressure in policymaking. I collect and analyze millions of public comments to develop the first systematic measures of civic engagement and influence in bureaucratic policymaking. The outline of the dissertation is as follows:

## Robustness

The main models (2 and 4) from Table \@ref(tab:ej-tables) use agency fixed effects and an indicator for whether at least one comment raised EJ concerns. Table \@ref(tab:ej-appendix1) presents roughly the same models to confirm that results are not driven by agencies that have little contact with EJ issues or rules that have little to do with EJ issues. 
Models "2 EPA Only" and "4 EPA Only" are identical to Models 2 and 4 but subset to EPA rules instead of agency fixed effects. 
Models "2 Mass Only" and "4 Mass Only" are identical to Models 2 and 4 but subset to rules that received over 100 comments.
Models "2 EJ Only" and "4 EJ Only" are identical to Models 2 and 4, but subset to rules that received at least one comment raising EJ concerns instead of including the indicator. 

```{r ej-appendix1}
# app table fixest
modelsummary::modelsummary( modelsFE1, 
                            title = "Logit Regression Predicting Change in Rule Text (Data Subsets)",
                            stars = TRUE, 
                            coef_map = cm,
                            gof_omit = "R.*",
                          add_rows = rowsFE1, 
                          notes = "") %>% 
  row_spec(row = 1, bold = T) %>%
  kable2(file = "ej-appendix2")

## Alternative specification


Table \@ref(tab:ej-appendix2) presents an alternative specification as robustness checks for the main models 2 and 4 in Table \@ref(tab:ej-appendix1). While we have strong reasons to believe that comments have decreasing marginal effects, and the logged number of comments offers a parsimonious modeling strategy, the models in Table \@ref(tab:ej-appendix2) relax this assumption about functional form by using both linear and quadratic terms instead. In these tables, "Total Comments" is measured in thousands, whereas "Unique EJ Comments" is not transformed. With this specification, most hypotheses cannot be assessed by the p-value on any one term. Instead, Figures \@ref(fig:ej-robust) and \@ref(fig:ej-robust-ej) show predicted probabilities at various levels of public attention (total comments) and coalition size (unique EJ comments), respectively, while holding other variables at their modal values. 

```{r ej-appendix2}
# app table fixest 2
modelsummary::modelsummary( modelsFE2, 
                            title = "Logit Regression Predicting Change in Rule Text",
                            #stars = TRUE, 
                            coef_map = cm,
                            gof_omit = "R.*",
                          add_rows = rowsFE2, 
                          notes = "") %>% 
  row_spec(row = 1, bold = T)  %>%
  kable2(file = "ej-appendix2")

## Rates of Addressing EJ by Agency

Table \@ref(tab:ej-rates) shows the total number of final rules and the percent that address EJ for the twenty agencies that most frequently mention EJ in final rules. 

```{r ej-rates}
load(here::here("05-ej", "ej_rates.Rdata"))

ej_rates %>% kable3(caption = 'Rates of Mentioning "Environmental Jusitce" in Final Rules')
```


Figure \@ref(fig:ej-m-PR-agency-top) shows estimated variation in rates of adding EJ to final rules across agencies.
Some agencies have dedicated staff and prominent internal guidance on EJ analysis in rulemaking, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation (which includes the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA),    Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), and  Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)). These agencies are among the most responsive to commenters raising EJ concerns. However, differences among agencies are fairly uncertain due to the small number of rules where EJ was added at most agencies. Combined with the main results (models 1 and 3 in Table \@ref(tab:ej-tables)), these differences in responsiveness add further support for the *Policy Receptivity Hypothesis* (\@ref(hyp:ej-receptivity)), but differences between agencies with different missions and institutional practices regarding EJ are not clear cut.


```{r ej-m-PR-agency-top, fig.cap = 'Probability  that "Environmental Justice" is Added Between Draft and Final Rules by Agency',out.width = "100%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "ej-m-PR-agency-top-1.png"))

```


<!--
The Forest Service (FS) has by far the highest predicted baseline rate of adding EJ to rules. This may be because the forest service is mainly in
the business of managing forests, leasing timber rights, and controlling
wildfires. These types of decisions have acute distributional
effects. Forest Service rule-writers may also simply have an institutional practice of addressing E.O.12898. 
Similarly, the Federal
Railroad Administration,  Federal Highway
Administration Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration all have large baseline rates of adding EJ to final rules. These agencies make decisions about infrastructure projects with implications for
neighborhood environments and air quality. Environmental justice may
often come up.
Research agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), also have low but significant baseline rate of adding EJ to final rules.
