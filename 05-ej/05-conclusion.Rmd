## Conclusion {#ej-conclusion}

This analysis presents a rare, systematic account of a social movement's impact on specific policy outcomes across institutions and over time. It illustrates the importance of ideas in policymaking and how social movements can affect the policy process, even technocratic processes like agency rulemaking, where most U.S. law is now made. 

When activists raise issue frames
like environmental justice, there is a higher probability that
policymakers engage in discourse that highlights the distributive effects of policy. However, baseline rates of addressing environmental justice in rulemaking are so low that, even when activists raise EJ concerns, most policy documents pay no explicit attention to EJ. We see this general lack of attention across agencies and across the G.W. Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations. Indeed, I find surprisingly small differences across administrations in both baseline rates of considering EJ and the relationship between public pressure and policy change. 
There is a great deal of variation across agencies, suggesting that policy receptivity and responsiveness to public input are conditional on
institutional factors. Some agencies are more receptive to claims about distributive justice than others.
Bureaucracies are specialized institutions built to make and implement certain kinds of policies based on certain goals and types of legitimate knowledge. Each agency has distinct norms and biases. Some may see an issue as "environmental" where others do not. Likewise, some may see disparate impacts that demand consideration as issues of fairness and distributive "justice" where other officials, with different norms and training, see no such disparity. In short, some policymakers appear to see their policy area as more related to environmental justice than others and thus be more receptive to commenters' concerns. 

The policy outcomes suggested by an environmental justice analysis depend on how the populations of concern are defined. In some cases, those raising environmental justice concerns
present it as an economic inequality issue, leading policy to
account for disparate impacts on low-income populations. In other cases,
groups raise claims rooted in cultural practices, such as fish
consumption among certain tribes. As occurred in the Mercury Rule, the
analysis in subsequent drafts of the policy used evaluative criteria
specific to these communities. Thus, policy outcomes
will depend on the specific environmental justice concerns raised. Future research should assess the relationship between specific EJ claims and corresponding policy changes. 

Which communities and concerns are raised by activist campaigns depend on second-order representation---who makes decisions in the organizations that mobilize public pressure. Examining which groups raise environmental justice concerns and second-order participation in these organizations' advocacy decisions validates some of the skepticism about who is able to
participate and make their voice heard. Elite groups dominate policy lobbying, even for
an issue like environmental justice. National
advocacy organizations frequently request that regulators protect
"all people" or even "low-income communities of color." However, this
more generic advocacy may not lead to the same outcomes as participation by groups that can present more specific local environmental justice concerns unique to a community. 

Several kinds of organizations raise environmental justice concerns. 
Some are generic progressive advocacy organizations like CREDO. Others are community-based organizations like WEACT. Linking these two are high-capacity national organizations like the Sierra Club and Earthjustice that frequently partner with local organizations for more place-based litigation and campaigns. These relationships may lead these organizations to be more likely to raise these local concerns in
national policymaking than groups like CREDO that focus almost exclusively on national campaigns. Given the importance of federal policy for local environmental outcomes, and advocacy organizations' potential to draw policymakers' attention to environmental justice issues, future research should examine the quality of partnerships between frontline communities and national advocacy organizations.

In the end, the above analysis offers some clarity on two poorly
understood and rarely linked features of American politics: the policy impact of social movements and the role of public pressure in bureaucratic policymaking. It offers
some hope that policymakers may at least acknowledge concerns raised through direct democracy
mechanisms like public comment periods. At the same time, it highlights how policymakers rarely explicitly address the disparate impacts of policy, even when directly confronted with distributive justice concerns.   Social movements do affect the policy process, but there are steep odds to overcome.
