# Conclusion

This analysis has illustrated the importance of ideas in policymaking and challenges in assessing their impact. The results suggest that when issue frames
like environmental justice are raised, there is a higher probability that
policymakers consider the effects on marginalized populations. However, baseline rates of addressing environmental justice in rulemaking are so low that even as the probability that agencies will at least mention environmental justice increases when commenters raise these issues, in most rules, even those where commenters raise EJ concerns, there is no explicit attention to EJ. This holds across presidents G.W. Bush, Obama, and Trump. Indeed, there are surprisingly small differences across administrations in both baseline rates of considering EJ and the relationship between comments and change in rule text. 
Importantly, there is a great deal of variation across agencies, suggesting that predispositions, policy receptiveness, and responsiveness to comments conditional on an
institutional being predisposed to such an analysis.

Furthermore, it is essential to note that the policy outcomes suggested
by environmental justice analysis depend on how minority populations are
defined. In some cases, those raising environmental justice concerns
present it as an issue of wealth or income inequality, leading policy to
account for disparate impacts on low-income populations. In other cases,
groups raise claims rooted in cultural practices, such as fish
consumption among certain tribes. As occurred in the Mercury Rule, the
analysis in subsequent drafts of the policy used evaluative criteria
specific to these communities.

The ability of a frame like environmental justice to construct certain
populations as deserving of consideration means that policy outcomes
will depend on the specific environmental justice concerns raised. In
this respect, second-order representation may become important. National
advocacy organizations may frequently request that regulators protect
"all people" or even "low-income communities of color." However, this
more generic advocacy may not lead to the same outcomes as groups that
present specific local environmental justice grievances that are unique
to a community. In between generic progressive advocacy organizations
and community-based organizations are organizations like the Sierra Club and Earthjustice, who, despite their national focus, frequently engaged in
community-specific litigation or place-based and thus raise these local concerns in
national policymaking. Given the importance of federal policy for local environmental outcomes, and advocacy organizations' potential to draw policymakers' attention to environmental justice issues, future research should examine the quality of partnerships between frontline communities and national advocacy organizations.

The examination of which groups raise environmental justice concerns and
second-order participation in these organizations' advocacy decisions validates some of the skepticism about who is able to
participate and make their voice heard. Elite groups dominate policy lobbying, even for
an issue like environmental justice.

In the end, the above analysis offers some clarity on a poorly
understood but important mechanism of U.S. policymaking. It offers
some hope that citizen opinions may be heard through direct democracy
institutions built into bureaucratic policymaking. At the same time, it highlights how disparate impacts are explicitly considered in a tiny percentage of policies.
