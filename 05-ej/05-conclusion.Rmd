# Conclusion

This analysis has illustrated the importance of ideas in policymaking
and cross-sectional statistical results suggest that when issue frames
like environmental justice are raised there is a higher probability that
policymakers consider the effects on marginalized populations.
Importantly this relationship seems to be conditional on an
institutional environment that is predisposed to such an analysis.
Furthermore, it is important to note that the policy outcomes suggested
by environmental justice analysis depend on how minority populations are
defined. In some cases, those raising environmental justice concerns
present it as an issue of wealth or income inequality, leading policy to
account for disparate impacts on low-income populations. In other cases,
groups raise claims rooted in cultural practices, such as fish
consumption among certain tribes. As occurred in the Mercury Rule, the
analysis in subsequent drafts of the policy used evaluative criteria
specific to these communities.

The ability of a frame like environmental justice to construct certain
populations as deserving of consideration means that policy outcomes
will depend on the specific environmental justice concerns raised. In
this respect, second-order representation may become important. National
advocacy organizations may frequently request that regulators protect
"all people" or even "low-income communities of color." However, this
more generic advocacy may not lead to the same outcomes as groups that
present specific local environmental justice grievances that are unique
to a community. In between generic progressive advocacy organizations
and community-based organizations are organizations like Earthjustice
who, despite their national focus, frequently engaged in
community-specific litigation and thus raise these local concerns in
national policymaking.

In the end, the above analysis offers some clarity on a poorly
understood but important mechanism of American policymaking. It offers
some hope that citizen opinions may be heard through direct democracy
institutions built into bureaucratic policymaking. The examination of
second-order participation validates some of the skepticism about who
participates. It is elite groups who participate, even with respect to
an issue like environmental justice. However, government responsiveness
does not seem to depend on mass mobilization or elite support. Compared
to cases where environmental justice issues were not raised, when they
are, we see a significantly higher probability that they will be
addressed by policymakers.
