# Results

## Are final rules more likely to address environmental justice after comments do so?

This subsection presents results from an analysis of draft
rules, comments, and final rules. Descriptively, figure
\@ref(fig:ej-PR-winrate-1)
shows that, in general, where environmental
justice is not addressed in the draft rule, it is also not addressed in the final, but a higher percent of rules do add EJ language when comments raise EJ concerns. There is a large difference in the rate of addressing EJ between rules where commenters and did (33%) and did not raise EJ concerns (4%). However, in most cases, agencies did not respond at all to these commenters' concerns.

```
-->


Figure \@ref(fig:ej-PR-winrate-2) shows that overall rates of adding EJ in rules without EJ comments decreased over time, leveling out at 3% during the Obama and Trump presidencies. The rates of adding EJ when commenters did raise these concerns is consistently much higher, but it also decreases over time, from 57% under G.W. Bush to 26% under Trump.
Finally, looking at selected agencies, Figure \@ref(fig:ej-PR-winrate-2) shows that EPA had a relatively high baseline rate of change (10%), which increased to 52% when comments raised EJ concerns. Most other agencies also added EJ at a higher rate when comments raised EJ concerns; indeed, most agencies almost never do so when comments did not raise EJ concerns.

### Estimating *Whether* "Environmental Justice" is Added to Final Rule

Given differences across presidents, agencies, and the number of comments, I estimate logit regression where the outcome is whether environmental justice was addressed in the final rule (Models 1 and 2 in table \@ref(tab:tables). The predictors are
whether EJ was addressed in the comments, the number of unique comments addressing EJ, the total number of comments, and the interaction between whether EJ was raised and the total number of comments received. Models 3 and 4 are exactly the same as 1 and 2, except that the outcome is now change in how EJ is discussed (described in the next section). All models include fixed effects for presidential administration and. Models 2 and 4 also include fixed effects for agency. Thus, estimates in Models 1 and 3 include variation *across* agencies, while estimates in models 2 and 4 rely on variation *within* agencies. All estimates rely on variation within the presidential administration. 
<!--The base equation for model 1 is shown below.-->
Predicted probabilities shown below are for models with agency fixed effects, 2 and 4.

### Predicted Probability of Added Text

As logit coefficients are not easily interpretable, I present
predicted probabilities for the types of rules of interest.
Figure \@ref(fig:ej-m-PR-comments-agencyFE) shows the predicted probability of a final rule addressing environmental justice when the draft rule did not with a varying number of comments (with other variables at their modal values: President Obama, the EPA, and zero additional EJ comments).^[All predicted probability plots below also use President Obama, the EPA, 0 additional EJ comments, and the median number of total comments as the baseline values, unless otherwise specified.] 
At low numbers of total comments, environmental justice being raised in any one comment does have a
statistically significant and substantively large effect. For rules with less than ten comments (most rules), one comment mentioning EJ is associated with a 30% increase in the probability that EJ will be addressed in the final rule. This supports the *Distributive Information Hypothesis*. However, as in figure \@ref(fig:ej-PR-winrate-1), the resulting rate is still below 50%---even when comments raise EJ concerns, agencies do not address them. As the number of comments increases, the probability that a rule will add text addressing EJ increases. At the same time, there is a small but negative interaction effect between the number of comments and EJ comments--the more comments, the smaller the relationship between the comments raising EJ and EJ being addressed in the rule. In the small-portion of highly salient rules with 10,000 or more, the presence of comments raising EJ concerns no longer has a significant relationship with EJ being added to the text. With or without EJ comments, these rules have about the same probability of change as those with just one EJ comment, just under 50%. This is evidence against the *Conditional Pressure Hypothesis*---the number of comments matters (i.e., the scale of public attention) matters regardless of whether these comments explicitly raise EJ concerns. However, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ej-comments), very few rules with 10,000 or more comments do not have at least one comment mentioning EJ, so there is a great deal of uncertainty about estimates of the impact of EJ comments with high levels of public attention.

The probability of
"environmental justice" appearing in the final rule also increases with the number of unique comments that mention "environmental justice" in models 2, 3, and 4, but it does not have a significantly positive relationship in Model 1. Overall this supports the *Repeated Information Hypothesis*.

```


Figure \@ref(fig:ej-m-PR-agency-top) shows estimated variation in rates of adding EJ to final rules.
Agencies with the largest average rates adding EJ language are the agencies we would expect to be more receptive to EJ claims.  While many agencies make what could be called "environmental policy" and all policy decisions have distributive consequences, the Environmental Protection Agency have the Department of Transportation (which includes the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)) the most prominent internal guidance on EJ in rulemaking. However, differences among agencies are fairly uncertain due to the small number of rules where EJ was added at most agencies. Thus, there is more support for the **Policy Receptivity Hypothesis than against it, but differences between agencies with different missions and institutional practices regarding EJ is not clear cut.

```



The Forest Service (FS) has the highest predicted baseline rate of adding EJ to their rules. This may be because the forest service is mainly in
the business of managing forests, leasing timber rights, and controlling
wildfires. These types of decisions may have acute distributional
effects that may not be the initial focus of the agency. Forest Service rule-writers may also simply have a practice of addressing E.O.12898 in final rules but not draft rules. 

Similarly, the Federal
Railroad Administration, Department of Transportation, Federal Highway
Administration, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration all have large baseline rates of adding EJ to final rules. These agencies are
making decisions about infrastructure projects with implications for
neighborhood environments and air quality. Environmental justice may
often come up, but there may be a lot of variation in whether the agency
then decides if they are relevant to transportation policies and
projects that are primarily about neither environmental nor justice
concerns.

Research agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also have a statistically significant but small baseline rate of adding EJ to final rules, indicating a large difference but rare event. Indeed, as we saw in Figure \@ref(fig:ejejPR-winrate-1), there are only three NRC proposed rules in these data that received EJ comments, and the agency added EJ language to two of them. Thirty-one draft NOAA rules received EJ comments, five of which added EJ language. 


## Are rules more likely to change how they address environmental justice when comments mention it?

Turning to rules that do address EJ in the draft, we also see responsiveness to comments raising EJ concerns, now measured as whether any sentences containing "environmental justice" changed between draft and final rule.
Figure \@ref(fig:ejejPR-winrate-1) shows that a higher percent of rules change when comments raise EJ concerns. Overall rates of change in rules without EJ comments are fairly consistent across presidencies.

```
-->

Finally, looking at selected agencies, Figure \@ref(fig:ejejPR-winrate-2) that most rules that addressed EJ in the draft were published by the EPA, which had a high rate of baseline change, which increased when comments raised EJ concerns. Other agencies had too few rules to make strong inferences, but many changed how they discussed EJ 100% of the time when comments raised it, while inconsistently doing so when comments did not.

### Estimating Change in *How* "Environmental Justice is Addressed

Models 3 and 4 in Table \@ref(tab:tables) are the same as Models 1 and 2, except that the dependent variable is now whether any sentences mentioning EJ changed between the draft and final rule.

### Predicted Probability of Changed Text

Controlling for average rates of change per agency and the number of comments, Figure \@ref(fig:ej-mejPR-president-mean-1) shows there are no significant differences in baseline rates of adding EJ language across the Bush, Obama, and Trump presidencies. All are significantly lower than the rate in the Clinton administration, which could be a result of Clinton's Executive Order or simply an artifact of the limited sample of rules posted to regulations.gov before the mid-2000s. 

```{r ej-mejPR-president-mean-1, fig.cap = "Predicted Change in How Environmental Justice is Addressed Between Draft and Final Rules by Number of Comments", out.width = "75%"}

```

The number of comments matters, but in the opposite direction posited by the *General Pressure Hypothesis*. The logged total number of comments has a significantly negative relationship with the probability the final rule text changes. The more comments there are on a proposed rule, the less likely it is to change. Rules are more likely to change when they receive *fewer* comments. The total number of comments thus has the opposite relationship to *how* rules that already addressed EJ changed as it did to *whether* rules added any EJ text. While the *General Pressure Hypothesis* held for adding EJ text, the opposite is true for changing a text that already addressed EJ. Instead, this result supports the competing intuition that more salient rules may be harder to change because the agency has anticipated public scrutiny. Their position set forth in the draft is more likely to be the position of the final rule.

As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ej-mejPR-comments), EJ comments have a small but discernable relationship to the probability of rule change at typical (low) numbers of comments. However, the relationship between the number of comments and the probability of rule change is different when some comments mentioned environmental justice. Specifically, the interaction term is positive; more comments overall means that environmental justice comments have a larger effect. When the total number of comments is larger, the positive interaction between the number of comments and comments mentioning EJ means that the predicted probability of change in how a rule addresses EJ is larger when the agency receives comments mentioning EJ.
