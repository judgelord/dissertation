### Are final rules more likely to address environmental justice after comments do so?

<!--Figure
\@ref(fig:ej-PR-winrate-1)
shows that, in general, -->

Where environmental justice is not addressed in the draft rule, a higher percent of rules add EJ language when comments raise EJ concerns. Descriptively,  there is a large difference in the rate of addressing EJ between rules where commenters and did (33%) and did not raise EJ concerns (4%). However, in most cases (67%), agencies did not respond at all when commenters raised EJ concerns.

Rates of adding EJ in rules without EJ comments decreased over time, leveling out at 3% during the Obama and Trump presidencies. Rates of adding EJ when commenters raised EJ concerns are consistently much higher, but it also decreases over time, from 57% under G.W. Bush to 26% under Trump.
<!--Finally, looking at selected agencies, Figure \@ref(fig:ej-PR-winrate-2) shows that-->
EPA had a relatively high baseline rate of change (10%), which increased to 52% when comments raised EJ concerns. Most other agencies also added EJ at a higher rate when comments raised EJ concerns; indeed, most agencies almost never do so when comments did not raise EJ concerns.

### Estimating *Whether* "Environmental Justice" is Added to Final Rule
-->

To account for differences across presidents, agencies, and the number of comments, I estimate logit regression. For models 1 and 2 in Table \@ref(tab:ej-tables), the outcome is whether the agency added environmental justice to the final rule. The predictors are
whether comments raised EJ concerns, the number of unique (non-form letter) comments addressing EJ, the total number of comments (including form letters), and the interaction between the total number of comments and whether any comments raised EJ concerns. Models 3 and 4 are the same as models 1 and 2, except that the outcome is whether the policy text changed how EJ is discussed (described in the next section). All models include fixed effects for the presidential administration. Models 2 and 4 also include fixed effects for agency. Thus, estimates in Models 1 and 3 include variation *across* agencies, whereas estimates in models 2 and 4 only rely on variation *within* agencies. All estimates rely on variation *within* each presidential administration. 
<!--The base equation for model 1 is shown below.-->
All predicted probabilities shown below include agency fixed effects, models 2 and 4.

#### The Predicted Probability of Added Text

As logit coefficients are not easily interpretable, Figures \@ref(fig:ej-m-PR-president-median-1), \@ref(fig:ej-m-PR-comments-agencyFE), and  \@ref(fig:ej-m-PR-agency-top) show the predicted probability of a final rule addressing environmental justice when the draft rule did not. 

Controlling for average rates of policy change per agency and the number of comments, Figure \@ref(fig:ej-m-PR-president-median-1) shows a large increase in the probability of policy change when comments raise EJ concerns. This supports the *Distributive Claims Hypothesis* (\@ref(hyp:ej-claims)). When comments raise distributive justice concerns, they are more likely to be addressed in the final policy. Rates of adding EJ language decrease after the G.W. Bush Administration, but differences between presidents are small compared to the difference between rules that did and did not receive EJ comments.  Other variables are held at their modal values: the EPA, zero additional EJ comments, and one comment total.^[All predicted probability plots below also show probabilities at the modal values for other variables: President Obama, the EPA, zero additional EJ comments, and the median number of total comments (one comment for models 1 and 2; four comments for models 3 and 4) unless otherwise specified.] 

```{r ej-m-PR-president-median-1, fig.cap = 'Probability that "Environmental Justice" is Added Between Draft and Final Rules by President', out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "ej-m-PR-president-median-1.png"))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:ej-m-PR-comments-agencyFE) shows the probability that an agency will add EJ language given different total numbers of comments. 
At low numbers of comments, anyone comment raising environmental justice has a strong relationship with policy change. For rules with less than ten comments (most rules), one comment mentioning EJ is associated with a 30% increase in the probability that EJ will be addressed in the final rule. This supports the *Distributive Claims Hypothesis* (\@ref(hyp:ej-claims)). However, <!--as in figure \@ref(fig:ej-PR-winrate-1), -->
the probability that an agency will add EJ language is still below 50%---even when comments raise EJ concerns, agencies tend not to address them. 

As the number of comments increases, the probability that a rule will add text addressing EJ increases. This supports the *Public Attention Hypothesis* (\@ref(hyp:ej-attention))---policy change is more likely when there is more public attention to a policy process. Simultaneously, there is a negative interaction between the number of comments and EJ comments---the more comments, the smaller the relationship between comments raising EJ and agencies addressing EJ in the rule. In the small-portion of highly salient rules with 10,000 or more, the presence of comments raising EJ concerns no longer has a statistically significant relationship with agencies adding EJ to the text. With or without EJ comments, these rules have about the same probability of change as those with just one EJ comment, just under 50%. This is evidence against the *Public Pressure Hypothesis* (\@ref(hyp:ej-public-pressure))---the number of comments matters (i.e., the scale of public attention) matters regardless of whether these comments explicitly raise EJ concerns. However, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ej-comments), few rules with 10,000 or more comments do not have at least one comment mentioning EJ, so we are highly uncertain about estimates of the impact of EJ comments with high levels of public attention. We can be much more confident about the relationship between comments raising EJ concerns and rule change at lower, more typical levels of public attention.

The probability of
"environmental justice" appearing in the final rule also increases with the number of unique comments mentioning "environmental justice" in models 2, 3, and 4. Overall this supports the *Repeated Claims Hypothesis* (\@ref(hyp:ej-repeated-claims)). 


```{r ej-m-PR-comments-agencyFE, fig.cap = "Probability Environmental Justice is Added Between Draft and Final Rules by Number of Comments", out.width = "80%", fig.show = "hold"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "ej-m-PR-comments-agencyFE-1.png"))

```


Figure \@ref(fig:ej-m-PR-agency-top) shows estimated variation in rates of adding EJ to final rules across agencies.
Agencies with the largest average rates of adding EJ language are the agencies we would expect to be more receptive to EJ claims.  While many agencies make policies that could be framed as "environmental," and all policy decisions have distributive consequences, institutions have norms and procedures that lead policymakers to see problems in different ways. For example, some agencies have dedicated staff and prominent internal guidance on EJ analysis in rulemaking, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation (which includes the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)). These agencies are among the most responsive to commenters raising EJ concerns. However, differences among agencies are fairly uncertain due to the small number of rules where EJ was added at most agencies. Thus, there is more support for the *Policy Receptivity Hypothesis* ((\@ref(hyp:ej-receptivity))) than against it, but differences between agencies with different missions and institutional practices regarding EJ are not clear cut.

```


<!--
The Forest Service (FS) has by far the highest predicted baseline rate of adding EJ to rules. This may be because the forest service is mainly in
the business of managing forests, leasing timber rights, and controlling
wildfires. These types of decisions have acute distributional
effects. Forest Service rule-writers may also simply have an institutional practice of addressing E.O.12898. 
Similarly, the Federal
Railroad Administration,  Federal Highway
Administration, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration all have large baseline rates of adding EJ to final rules. These agencies are
making decisions about infrastructure projects with implications for
neighborhood environments and air quality. Environmental justice may
often come up.
Research agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), also have small but significant baseline rate of adding EJ to final rules.

### Are rules more likely to change how they address environmental justice when comments mention it?

Turning to rules that do address EJ in the draft, we also see responsiveness to comments raising EJ concerns, now measured as whether any sentences containing "environmental justice" changed between draft and final rule.
Models 3 and 4 in Table \@ref(tab:ej-tables) are the same as Models 1 and 2, except that the dependent variable is now whether any sentences mentioning EJ changed between the draft and final rule.


<!-- WINRATE CHANGE 
Figure \@ref(fig:ejejPR-winrate-1) shows that a higher percent of rules change when comments raise EJ concerns. Overall rates of change in rules without EJ comments are fairly consistent across presidencies.

```{r ejejPR-winrate-1, fig.cap = "Percent of Rules that Changed in How they Addressed Environmental Justice", out.width="60%",  fig.show = "hold"}

```

Finally, looking at selected agencies, Figure \@ref(fig:ejejPR-winrate-2) shows that. 
/WINRATE CHANGE-->

Most rules that addressed EJ in the draft were published by the EPA. The EPA had a high rate of baseline change, which increased when comments raised EJ concerns. Other agencies had too few draft rules mentioning EJ to make strong inferences, but many changed how they discussed EJ 100% of the time when comments raised EJ concerns, while inconsistently doing so when comments did not.

#### The Predicted Probability of Changed Text

Controlling for average rates of change per agency and the number of comments, Figure \@ref(fig:ej-mejPR-president-median-1) shows little difference in baseline rates of changing EJ language across the Bush, Obama, and Trump presidencies. All are significantly lower than the Clinton administration's rate, which could be related to Clinton's Executive Order on environmental justice or simply an artifact of the limited sample of rules posted to regulations.gov before the mid-2000s. 

```{r ej-mejPR-president-median-1, fig.cap = "Predicted Change in *How* Environmental Justice is Addressed Between Draft and Final Rules by President", out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "ej-mejPR-president-median-1.png"))
```

For draft rules that already addressed EJ, the relationship between the total number of comments and policy change is in the opposite direction posited by the *Public Attention Hypothesis* (\@ref(hyp:ej-attention)). The logged total number of comments is inversely related to change in the final rule text. The more comments on a proposed rule, the less likely it is to change. Rules are more likely to change when they receive *fewer* comments. Thus, the total number of comments has the opposite relationship to *how* rules that already addressed EJ changed as it did to *whether* rules added any EJ text. While the *Public Attention Hypothesis* (\@ref(hyp:ej-attention)) explained adding EJ text where none existed in the draft, the opposite is true for changing a text that already addressed EJ. Instead, this result supports the competing intuition that more salient rules may be harder to change because the agency has anticipated public scrutiny. Their position stated in the draft is more likely to be the position of the final rule.

As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ej-mejPR-comments), EJ comments have a small but discernable relationship to the probability of rule change at typical (low) numbers of comments. As the total number of comments increases, the estimated difference between policies that did and did not receive EJ comments increases. When no comments mention EJ, a rule that receives 10,000 comments is much less likely to change than a rule that received 10,000. When comments do raise EJ concerns, more public attention has a smaller impact on the probability of policy change.
