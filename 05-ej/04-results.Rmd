# Results

## Are final rules more likely to address environmental justice after comments do so?

This subsection presents results from an analysis of draft
rules, comments, and final rules. Descriptively, figure
\@ref(fig:ejwinrate)
shows that in general, most rules that do not address environmental
justice in the draft but these issues are raised in the comments, do not
end up addressing them in the final version. It appears that it may have
been the case in 2006 and 2007 but since then the number of rules
receiving comments raising environmental justice concerns has grown
while the number of rules that end up adding it has remained the same.
Since 2015, there has been a decline in both the number of rules adding
environmental justice and the number of rules where commenters demanded
it, especially in 2017. One way to interpret figure
\@ref(fig:ejwinrate)
would be to say that commenters saw a potential ally in President Obama
and increased their demands for environmental justice, but that these
increased demands had little effect. However, a better approach would be
to estimate a statistical model of the effect of comments on the change
from draft to final rules. This is what I do.

### Estimating *Whether* "Evironmental Justice" is Added to Final Rule

For this  analysis, I estimate a logit regression where the outcome is whether environmental justice was addressed in the final rule. The predictors are
whether it was addressed in the comments, the number of unique comments addressing EJ, the total number of comments and the interaction between whether EJ was raised and the total number of comments received. I also include fixed effects for presidential administration and, in models 2 and 4, for agency. Thus, estimates in Models 1 and 3 include variaion *across* agencies while estimates in models 2 and 4 rely on variation *within* agencies. All estimates rely on variation within presidential administration. The base equastion for model 1 is shown below. Model 3 is identical except for the dependent variable. Predicted probabilities shown below are for models with agency fixed effects, 2 and 4.

### Predicted Probability of Added Text

As logit coefficients are not easily interpretable, I present
predicted probabilities for the types of rules of interest.
Figure \@ref(fig:ej-m-PR-comments-agencyFE) shows the predicted probability of a final rule addressing environmental justice when the draft rule did not with a varying number of comment, while holding president and agency at their modal values, President Obama, the EPA, and 0 additional EJ comments.^[All predicted probability plots below also use President Obama, the EPA, and 0 additional EJ comments as the baseline values.] 
At low numbers of total comments, environmental justice being raised in any one comment does have a
statistically significant and substantively large effect. For rules with less than 10 comments (most rules), one comment mentioning EJ is a associated with a 30% increase in the probaibilty that EJ will be addressed in the final rule. This supports the *Distributive Information Hypothesis*. However, as in figure \@ref(fig:ej-PR-winrate), the resulting rate is still below 50%, meaning that, even when comments raise EJ concerns, agencies do not address them. As the number of comments increases 

The predicted probability of
"environmental justice" appearing the final rule also increases with the number of unique comments that mention "environmental justice" in models 2, 3, and 4, but it is does not have significantly positive relationship in Model 1. Overall this support the *Repeated Information Hypothesis*.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "ej-m-PR-comments-agencyFE-1.png"))

```


Figure \@ref(ej-m-PR-agency-top) shows estimated variation in rates of adding EJ to final rules.
Angencies with the largest average rates adding EJ langage are the agencies we would expect to be more receptive to EJ claims.  While many agencies make what could be called "environmental policy" and all policy decisions have distributive consequences, the Environmental Protection Agency have Department of Transportation (which includs the Federal
Railroad Administration (FRA), Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), and the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA)) the most prominant internal guidance on ej in rulemaking. However differences among agencies are fairly uncertian due to the small number of rules where EJ was added at most agencies. Thus, there is more support for the **Policy Receptivity Hypothesis than against it, but differences between agencies with different missions and institional practices regarding EJ is not clear cut.


```{r ej-m-PR-agency-top, fig.cap = "Proposed Rules Not Addressing Environmental Justice"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "ej-m-PR-agency-top-1.png"))
```



The Forest Service (FS) has the highest predicted baseline rate of adding EJ to their rules. This may be because the forest service is mainly in
the business of managing forests, leasing timber rights, and controlling
wildfires. These types of decisions may have acute distributional
effects that may not be the initial focus of the agency. Forest Service rule-writers may aslo simply have a practice of addressing E.O.12898 in final rules but not draft rules. 

Similarly, the Federal
Railroad Administration, Department of Transportation, Federal Highway
Administration, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, all have large baseline rates of adding EJ to final rules. These agencies are
making decisions about infrastructure projects with implications for
neighborhood environments and air quality. Environmental justice may
often come up, but there may be a lot of variation in whether the agency
then decides if they are relevant to transportation policies and
projects that are primarily about neither environmental nor justice
concerns.

Research agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Comission (NRC), National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also has statistically significant but small spreads baseline rate of adding EJ to final rules, indicating a large difference but rare event. Indeed, as we saw in Figure \@ref(fig:ejejPR-winrate-1), there are only thre NRC proposed rules in these data that recieved EJ commennts and the agency added EJ language to two of them. 15 draft NOAA rules recieved EJ comments, 5 of which had EJ language added. 


## Are rules more likley to change how they address environmental justice when comments mention it?

Turning to rules that do address EJ in the draft, we also see a responsiveness to comments raising EJ concerns, now measured as whather any sentences containing "environmental justice" changed between draft and final rule.
Figure \@ref(fig:ejejPR-winrate-1) shows that a higher percent of rules change when comments raise EJ concerns. Overall rates of change in rules without EJ comments are fairly consistant across presidencies.

```{r ejejPR-winrate-1, fig.cap = "Percent of Rules that Changed in How they Addressed Environmental Justice", out.width="49%",  fig.show = "hold"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "ejejPR-winrate-1.png"))


knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "ejejPR-winrate-president-1.png"))
```

<!--Considering the total number of comments, 

```{r ejejPR-winrate-comments-1, fig.cap = "Percent of Rules that Changed in How they Addressed Environmental Justice by Number of Comments"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "ejejPR-winrate-comments-1.png"))
```
-->

Finally, looking at a selected agences 

```{r ejejPR-winrate-agency-1, fig.cap = "Percent of Rules that Changed in How they Addressed Environmental Justice by Agency"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "ejejPR-winrate-agency-1.png"))
```


### Estimating Change in *How* "Environmental Justice is Addressed

Models 3 and 4 in Table \@ref(tab:table) are the same as Models 1 and 2, except for the dependent variable is now whether any sentences mentioning EJ changed between the draft and final rule.



### Predicted Probability of Changed Text

Controling for the agency and number of comments, there are no significant differences in baseline rates of adding EJ language across the Bush, Obama, and Trump presidencies. All are signifcantly lower than the rate in the Clinton adminstration, which could be a result of Clinton's Execututive order, or simply a artificat of the limited sample of rules posted to regulations.gov before the mid 2000s. 

```{r ej-mejPR-president-mean-1, fig.cap = "Predicted Change in How Environmental Justice is Addressed Between Draft and Final Rules by Number of Comments"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "ej-mejPR-president-mean-1.png"))
```

The number of comments matters. The logged total number of comments has significantly negative relationship with the probabiliy the final rule text changes. The more comments there are on a proposed rule, the less likely it is to change. Rules are more likely to change when they recieve *fewer* comments. This supports the idea that more salient rules may be harder to change because the agency has anticipated public scrutiny. Their position set forth in the draft is more likely to be the postion of the final rule.

Envrionmental justice comments have no decernable relationship to the probability of rule change at typical (low) numbers of comments. However, relationship between the number of comments and the probability of rule change is different when some comments mentioned envrionmental justice. Specifically, the interaction term is positve; more comments overall means that environmental justice comments have a larger effect. When the total number of comments is large (100 comments or more), the postive interaction between the number of comments and comments mentioning EJ means that the predicted probability of change in how a rule addresses EJ is signifantly larger when the agency recieves comments mentioning EJ.
