## Results

### Are final rules more likely to address environmental justice after comments do so?

This subsection presents results from an analysis of draft
rules, comments, and final rules. Descriptively, 
<!--figure
\@ref(fig:ej-PR-winrate-1)
shows that, in general, -->
where environmental
justice is not addressed in the draft rule, a higher percent of rules add EJ language when comments raise EJ concerns. There is a large difference in the rate of addressing EJ between rules where commenters and did (33%) and did not raise EJ concerns (4%). However, in most cases, agencies did not respond at all to these commenters' concerns.

<!--Figure \@ref(fig:ej-PR-winrate-2) shows that -->
Overall rates of adding EJ in rules without EJ comments decreased over time, leveling out at 3% during the Obama and Trump presidencies. The rates of adding EJ when commenters did raise these concerns is consistently much higher, but it also decreases over time, from 57% under G.W. Bush to 26% under Trump.
<!--Finally, looking at selected agencies, Figure \@ref(fig:ej-PR-winrate-2) shows that-->
EPA had a relatively high baseline rate of change (10%), which increased to 52% when comments raised EJ concerns. Most other agencies also added EJ at a higher rate when comments raised EJ concerns; indeed, most agencies almost never do so when comments did not raise EJ concerns.^[More discriptive statistics and figures are available in the online appendix.]

#### Estimating *Whether* "Environmental Justice" is Added to Final Rule
-->

Given differences across presidents, agencies, and the number of comments, I estimate logit regression where the outcome is whether environmental justice was addressed in the final rule (Models 1 and 2 in table \@ref(tab:tables)). The predictors are
whether EJ was addressed in the comments, the number of unique comments addressing EJ, the total number of comments, and the interaction between whether EJ was raised and the total number of comments received. Models 3 and 4 are exactly the same as 1 and 2, except that the outcome is now change in how EJ is discussed (described in the next section). All models include fixed effects for the presidential administration. Models 2 and 4 also include fixed effects for agency. Thus, estimates in Models 1 and 3 include variation *across* agencies, whereas estimates in models 2 and 4 rely on variation *within* agencies. All estimates rely on variation *within* the presidential administration. 
<!--The base equation for model 1 is shown below.-->
All predicted probabilities shown below include agency fixed effects, models 2 and 4.

#### Predicted Probability of Added Text

As logit coefficients are not easily interpretable, Figures \@ref(fig:ej-m-PR-president-median-1), \@ref(fig:ej-m-PR-comments-agencyFE), and  \@ref(fig:ej-m-PR-agency-top) show the predicted probability of a final rule addressing environmental justice when the draft rule did not. 

Controlling for average rates of policy change per agency and the number of comments, Figure \@ref(fig:ej-m-PR-president-median-1) shows a large difference in the probability of policy change when raising EJ concerns. This supports the "Distributive Information Hypothesis." There is a decrease in rates of adding EJ language after the G.W. Bush Administration, but differences between presidents are small compared to the difference between rules that did and did not see EJ comments.  Other variables at their modal values: the EPA, zero additional EJ comments, and one comment total.^[All predicted probability plots below also show probabilities at the modal values for other variables: President Obama, the EPA, zero additional EJ comments, and the median number of total comments (one for models 1 and 2; four for models 3 and 4) unless otherwise specified.] 

```{r ej-m-PR-president-median-1, fig.cap = "Probability Environmental Justice is Added Between Draft and Final Rules by President", out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "ej-m-PR-president-median-1.png"))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:ej-m-PR-comments-agencyFE) shows the probability of EJ language being added with a varying total number of comments. 
At low numbers of comments, environmental justice being raised in any one comment does have a decisive relationship with policy change. For rules with less than ten comments (most rules), one comment mentioning EJ is associated with a 30% increase in the probability that EJ will be addressed in the final rule. This supports the *Distributive Information Hypothesis*. However, <!--as in figure \@ref(fig:ej-PR-winrate-1), -->
the probability that an agency will add EJ language is still below 50%---even when comments raise EJ concerns, agencies tend not to address them. 

As the number of comments increases, the probability that a rule will add text addressing EJ increases. This supports the *General Pressure Hypothesis*--policy change is more likely when there is more public attention to a policy process. At the same time, there is a negative interaction between the number of comments and EJ comments--the more comments, the smaller the relationship between the comments raising EJ and EJ being addressed in the rule. In the small-portion of highly salient rules with 10,000 or more, the presence of comments raising EJ concerns no longer has a significant relationship with EJ being added to the text. With or without EJ comments, these rules have about the same probability of change as those with just one EJ comment, just under 50%. This is evidence against the *Specific Pressure Hypothesis*---the number of comments matters (i.e., the scale of public attention) matters regardless of whether these comments explicitly raise EJ concerns. However, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ej-comments), very few rules with 10,000 or more comments do not have at least one comment mentioning EJ, so there is a great deal of uncertainty about estimates of the impact of EJ comments with high levels of public attention.

The probability of
"environmental justice" appearing in the final rule also increases with the number of unique comments that mention "environmental justice" in models 2, 3, and 4. Overall this supports the *Repeated Information Hypothesis*.

```


Figure \@ref(fig:ej-m-PR-agency-top) shows estimated variation in rates of adding EJ to final rules across agencies.
Agencies with the largest average rates of adding EJ language are the agencies we would expect to be more receptive to EJ claims.  While many agencies make what could be framed as "environmental policy," and all policy decisions have distributive consequences, institutions have norms and procedures that lead policymakers to see problems in different ways. For example, a few agencies have prominent internal guidance on EJ analysis in rulemaking, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation (which includes the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)). However, differences among agencies are fairly uncertain due to the small number of rules where EJ was added at most agencies. Thus, there is more support for the **Policy Receptivity Hypothesis** than against it, but differences between agencies with different missions and institutional practices regarding EJ is not clear cut.

```



The Forest Service (FS) has the highest predicted baseline rate of adding EJ to their rules. This may be because the forest service is mainly in
the business of managing forests, leasing timber rights, and controlling
wildfires. These types of decisions have acute distributional
effects. Forest Service rule-writers may also simply have an institutional practice of addressing E.O.12898. 
Similarly, the Federal
Railroad Administration,  Federal Highway
Administration, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration all have large baseline rates of adding EJ to final rules. These agencies are
making decisions about infrastructure projects with implications for
neighborhood environments and air quality. Environmental justice may
often come up.
Research agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), also have small but significant baseline rate of adding EJ to final rules.


### Are rules more likely to change how they address environmental justice when comments mention it?

Turning to rules that do address EJ in the draft, we also see responsiveness to comments raising EJ concerns, now measured as whether any sentences containing "environmental justice" changed between draft and final rule.
<!--Figure \@ref(fig:ejejPR-winrate-1) shows that a higher percent of rules change when comments raise EJ concerns. Overall rates of change in rules without EJ comments are fairly consistent across presidencies.

```
-->
<!--
Finally, looking at selected agencies, Figure \@ref(fig:ejejPR-winrate-2) that

Most rules that addressed EJ in the draft were published by the EPA, which had a high rate of baseline change, which increased when comments raised EJ concerns. Other agencies had too few rules to make strong inferences, but many changed how they discussed EJ 100% of the time when comments raised it, while inconsistently doing so when comments did not.

#### Estimating Change in *How* "Environmental Justice" is Addressed
-->

Models 3 and 4 in Table \@ref(tab:tables) are the same as Models 1 and 2, except that the dependent variable is now whether any sentences mentioning EJ changed between the draft and final rule.

#### Predicted Probability of Changed Text

Controlling for average rates of change per agency and the number of comments, Figure \@ref(fig:ej-mejPR-president-median-1) shows little difference in baseline rates of adding EJ language across the Bush, Obama, and Trump presidencies. All are significantly lower than the rate in the Clinton administration, which could be a result of Clinton's Executive Order or simply an artifact of the limited sample of rules posted to regulations.gov before the mid-2000s. 

```{r ej-mejPR-president-median-1, fig.cap = "Predicted Change in *How* Environmental Justice is Addressed Between Draft and Final Rules by President", out.width = "80%"}

```

The relationship between the total number of comments and policy change is in the opposite direction posited by the *General Pressure Hypothesis*. The logged total number of comments has a significantly negative relationship with the probability the final rule text changes. The more comments there are on a proposed rule, the less likely it is to change. Rules are more likely to change when they receive *fewer* comments. The total number of comments thus has the opposite relationship to *how* rules that already addressed EJ changed as it did to *whether* rules added any EJ text. While the *General Pressure Hypothesis* held for adding EJ text, the opposite is true for changing a text that already addressed EJ. Instead, this result supports the competing intuition that more salient rules may be harder to change because the agency has anticipated public scrutiny. Their position set forth in the draft is more likely to be the position of the final rule.

As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ej-mejPR-comments), EJ comments have a small but discernable relationship to the probability of rule change at typical (low) numbers of comments. As the total number of comments increases, the estimated difference between policies that did and did not receive EJ comments increases. When no comments mention EJ, a rule that receives 10,000 comments is much less likely to change than a rule that received 10,000. When comments do raise EJ concerns, more public attention has a smaller impact on the probability of policy change.
