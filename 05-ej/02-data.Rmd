# Data

In order to examine whether environmental justice advocates or public pressure campaigns shape the discourse around policies,
I use the text of draft rules, public comments, and final rules retrieved from regulations.gov. I select rulemaking documents from agencies that pubished at least one rule explicitly addressing Environmental Justice fron 1992 through 2020. This yields 30348 rulemaking dockets from 44 agencies.  


Despite E.O. 12868, most rules do not address EJ. Figure \@ref(fig:ej-data) 

```{r ej-data, fig.cap = "Number of Proposed and Final Rules Addressing Environmental Justice.", out.height = NULL, out.width = "99%", fig.show = "hold"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "ej-data-ejpr-1.png") ) #  

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "ej-data-ejfr-1.png") ) # 
```

Even at the Environmetal Protection Agency (EPA), where most politices presumably are clearly related to "environmental" issues, a consistant minority of rules address EJ. Agencies almost never address EJ include agencies that make policy with clear EJ effects, including Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and Office of Surface Mining (OSM). A majority of rules addressed EJ only in a few years at a few agencies that publish relativly few rules such as the Concil of Environmental Quality (CEQ), Federal Emergancy Managment Agency (FEMA), and several Transportation agencies (the Federal High Way Administration, Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)). Figure \@ref(fig:ej-agencies100) shows the number of rulemaking projects at each agency over time by whether they ultimatly addressed EJ.

```

## Comments

Figure \@ref(fig:ej-comments) shows the number of comments on each proposed rule in published between 1992 and 2020. Red circles indicated rules where no commenters raised EJ concerns. Blue Triangles indicate rules where they did. The bottom row of plots show the subset of rules where environmental justice appeared in neither the draft nor final rule. The middle row of plots show rules where "environmental justice" appreared in the final but not the draft. My firest measure and anslysis compares these two rows. The top row of plots shows rules where "environmental justice" appeared in both the draft and final rule. Predictibly, commenters most often raised EJ concerns on this last set of rules.

## Interest Groups and Second-order Representation

When lobbying during rulemaking, groups often
make dubious claims to represent broad segments of the public [@Seifter2016UCLA]. It is thus insufficient to know which groups participate. We
also need to know who these groups claim to represent and whether those people are actually involved in the decisions of the organization.

I investigate who is raising environmental justice concerns in two ways.
First, I identify the top organizational commenters such as tribes,
businesses, and nonprofits that are using environmental justice language
and investigate who these groups represent. Second, for comments where a
citizen signed their name, I compare surnames to their racial and ethnic
identity propensities with respect to the U.S. census. Together these
two pieces of information allow me to comment on "second order"
representation, i.e. not just the extent to which public comments relate
to government policy, but the extent to which public comments are
representative of the public and of the groups they claim to represent [@Seifter2016UCLA].

Table \@ref(tab:orgs) shows the top 15 organizational commenters who
used the phrase "environmental justice" in their comments, including all
organizations who mobilized more than
100,000 total comments. The six organizations responsible for mobilizing
more than 100,000 comments and several others on the list are national
nonprofit advocacy groups. We Act and Communities for a Better
Environment are both more community-based groups focusing primarily on
environmental justice issues. Southern Company is the only corporation
on the list.

The top mobilizer of comments mentioning "environmental justice" between 1992 and 2020 was the Sierra Club with over 340,000 comments on dozens of rules. While it is membership organization whose members pay dues elect the leaders of local chapters and have some say in local advocacy efforts, its national advocacy is directed by a more traditional national advoacy organization funded by donations, including over $174 million from Bloomberg Philanthropies that funded several of the public pressure campagins in these data. Like other national advoacy groups, the Sierra Club advocates on behalf of "EJ and Frontline" communities, but those individuals have little formal say in the national organization's lobbying decisions. The Sierra Club does have a majore program arm dedicated to Environmetnal Justice and many local programs. As a federated organization with many local efforts, it is difficult to generalize about second-order representation, which likely varies across its campaigns. The national Borad of Directors adopted a statement on social justice in 1993 and principles on environmental justice in 2001. The website national does contain regular Spanish language content.

The second most prolific organizer of EJ commets was Earthjustice with over 175,000 comments on many of the same rules that the Sierra Club lobbied on. Earthjustice is primarily engaged in litigation on
behalf environmental causes. Their website boasts 2.2 million
supporters, but it is not clear who they are or if they play any role in
the advocacy strategy. A search on the website returns 360 results for
\"Environmental Justice,\" with the top results from staff biographies
who work on more local or targeted work such as environmental conditions
for the incarcerated, but the environmental justice language used on the
main page is relatively mild. For example, "We are fighting for a future
where children can breathe clean air, no matter where they live"
[@Earthjustice2017]. The website does contain Spanish language content.

The Natural Resources Defense Council is similar to Earthjustice--a
national nonprofit funded by donations and focused on litigation--but
they also lobby and organize public pressure campaigns, including over 160 thousand comments mentioning environmental justice. CREDO Action and MoveOn are more generic progressive
mobilizers who lack a systematic focus on environmental justice issues,
but occasionally leverage their very large membership lists to support
campaigns environmental justice campaigns led by others
[@MoveOn.org2017; @CREDO2017]. The Alliance for Climate Protection is a
more of an elite political group founded by former Vice President Al
Gore.

We Act and Communities for a Better Environment both have environmental
justice in their central mission statement. We Act was founded by
community leaders in Harlem, NY, to fight environmental racisms and
advocate for better air quality [@WEACT2017]. Communities for a Better
Environment has projects throughout California but is particularly
active in Oakland [@CBECAL2017CommunitiesEnvironment]. Much of the
content of their website is in both English and Spanish. Both
organizations focus primarily on "low-income communities of color" and
thus frame their work with respect to race and class. While both
organizations participated in national policymaking We Act is more
focused on communities in Harlem and New York whereas Communities for a
Better Environment casts a wider frame: \"CBE's vision of environmental
justice is global--that's why the organization continues to participate
in such international efforts as the Indigenous Environmental Network
and the Global Week of Action for Climate Justice\" [@CBECAL2017].

The Southern Company comments are too few to count as mass mobilization.
Companies do sometimes fund mobilization campaigns, but all 8 of
these comments were submitted by the Southern Company themselves. Interestingly,
the company repeatedly raises research into environmental justice
concerns in order to frame these issues as a legitimate but unresolved
scientific debate that is not yet conclusive enough to base regulations
on: \"People with lower SES are exposed to almost an order of magnitude
more traffic near their homes (Reynolds et al., 2001), and live closer
to large industrial sites and are exposed to more industrial air
pollution (Jerrett et al., 2001). Legitimate health concerns must be
addressed. But adopting standards with a scientific basis so uncertain
that health improvement cannot be assured is not sound public health
policy.\" Like many companies they claim to represent their customers as
\"electric generating companies and their customers are expected to bear
much of the burden\" of regulations [@Hobson2004].

With respect to second-order representation, it appears that the groups
most often using the language of environmental justice may do so
sincerely but do not themselves represent affected communities. Several
groups representing local communities and led by community leaders have
participated, but not nearly as often or with the same intensity as the
"big greens." This highlights the importance of resources as a condition
for mobilizing. Not all groups who may benefit from political
information are able to leverage it because they lack the resources to
invest in a campaign. However, it may be the case that smaller, more
member-driven groups join coalitions with groups with more resources who
mobilize on their behalf. 
Finally, a third, much less common type of commenter raises environmental justice issues
as a way to re-frame them as ongoing debates and thus undermine their
urgency. I call this reason for engaging as "breaking a perceived
consensus." In a way, the fact that an energy company felt compelled to
acknowledge and question environmental justice concerns suggests their
importance for policy outcomes.

### Commenter Race

To estimate the racial distribution of those who comment
using environmental justice language, I select commenters who
signed their full name on their comment with a name with a
surname appearing in census records. Figure
\@ref(fig:ejcommentsbyrace) shows a probabilistic racial
distribution of commenters who raise "environmental justice" concerns in
their comments based on distribution of self-reported racial identities
associated with surnames as recorded in the 2010 census^[I recode "Hispanic" as "Latinx"]. This distribution is estimated using the proportion of
people with a given surname identified as belonging to each racial
category (from this limited set of options). It does not
assign specific individuals to racial categories, but instead represents each commenter as a set of probabilities adding up to 1 and the estimated racial distribution of the sample as a sum of individual probabilitities.

```{r ejcommentsbyrace, fig.cap = 'Estimated Racial Distribution from Census Surnames of Commenters raising "Environmental Justice" Concerns in Rulemaking', out.height = NULL, out.width = "40%", fig.show = "hold"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "race-prob.pdf"))
```


Compared to the overall distribution in the 2010 census, this sample of commenters
appears to be disproportionately Black and less than proportionately
Latinx or Asian, with just slightly fewer Whites relative to the
national population. This makes sense given that environmental justice
theorizing and activism have been led by African Americans
[@Bullard1993].


# Tracing Ideas Throught Rulemaking 

## "Environmental Justice as a Contested Concept

The use of an environmental justice frame does not always imply the same
communities of concern. Environmental justice emerged out of movements
against environmental racism, especially the disposal of toxic
substances in predominatnly-Black neighobhoods [@Bullard1993]. However, the term
quickly took on a wider array of meanings, encompassing various marginalized
group. Bill Clinton's 1994 Executive Order on
Environmental Justice required all parts of the federal government
to make "addressing disproportionately high and adverse human health or
environmental effects of programs, policies, and activities on minority
populations and low-income populations" a core aspect of their mission.
This meant considering disproportionate effects during rulemaking.

In 2005, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) political apointees reinterpreted the Order, race as a factor in identifying and prioritizing populations.This move was critisised by activsts and two reports by EPA's own Office of Inspector General. President Obama's EPA Administrator named EJ as one of their top priorities, but also faced criticism from activists.

In an October 2017 proposed rule to repeal
restrictions on power plant pollution, the Trump EPA acknowledged that
"low-income and minority communities located in proximity to [power
plants] may have experienced an improvement in air quality as a result
of the emissions reductions." Because the Executive Order requires
attention to environmental justice and because the Obama EPA discussed
it when promulgating the rule, the environmental justice cannot safely
be ignored. However, the Trump EPA contended that the Obama EPA "did not
address lower household energy bills for low-income households [and
that] workers losing jobs in regions or occupations with weak labor
markets would have been most vulnerable" (EPA 2017). Like the comments of the Southern Company and other regulated industry commenters, these comments frame the distribution of jobs and electricty costs as environmental justice issues in order to push back against policy that would equalize distributions of health impacts of of pollution. 

The major conflict over the role of race in EJ anlalyeses is only one of many conflicts that the environmental justice movement has caused to be fought somewhat on its terms. To illusreate how these definitional conflicts shape rules and rulemaking, the next section briefly reviews the decades-long policy battle over regulating Murcury pollution.^[This case and others examples in this article were not selected as the most similar, most differet, or a represenative sample. They emerged from sreading rule making records. Their purporse is to assess whether the cases in the quantative analysis are plausabley what they appear to be: that changes in rule text are, sometimes, causally related to public comments and that non-changes are cases of agencies disregarding comments, not some accident of the data or measures. Tracing a somewhat random rulemaking processes also helped to avoid analitic pitfalls. For example, one case where an agency did an EJ anslysis and then appeared not to respond to a comment discussing EJ was in fact due to the fact that the commentor included an annotated version of the draft rule their comment, adding only "no comment' next to the 12898 section. To correct this, I removed text coppied from the proposed rule from comments in pre-processing. The qualitative reading also confirmed other key assumptions such as the fact that advocates do in fact use "environmental justice" when they raise distributional concerns, even on many rules that are not about issues traditioanlly considered "environmental" because of its power to give distributional justice claims gain legal purchase.]


### The Evolving Distributional Politics of Murcury Pollution

Fundamental definitions of the public good and minority rights are
implicit in agency rules. The public comment process offers an
opportunity to protest these definitions. Protest is one way that
marginalized groups can communicate opinions on issues to government
officials [@Gillion2013]. In the case of the EPA's Mercury Rules, two
such issues were decisive. First, as with many forms of pollution,
mercury-emitting power plants are concentrated in low-income, often
non-White communities. Second, certain populations consume much more
locally-caught freshwater fish, a major vector of Mercury toxicity.
Studies inspired by the political controversy around the Mercury Rules
found high risk among communities included "Hispanic, Vietnamese, and
Laotian populations in California and Great Lakes tribal populations
(Chippewa and Ojibwe) active on ceded territories around the Great
Lakes" (EPA 2012). Thus the standards that EPA chooses are fundamentally
dependent on whom the regulation aims to protect: the average citizen,
local residents, or fishing communities. This decision has disparate
effects based on race and class because of disparate effects based on
geography and different cultural practices. Such disparate impacts are
often called environmental justice issues.

In December 2000, when the EPA first announced its intention to regulate
Mercury from power plants, the notice published in the Federal Register
did not address environmental justice issues such as the disparate
effects of mercury on certain populations. Risks were only discussed in
reference to "the U.S. population" (EPA 2000). When the first draft rule
was published, it only discussed the effects of the rule on regulated
entities, noting that "Other types of entities not listed could also be
affected" (EPA 2002). Commenting on this draft, Heather McCausland of
the Alaska Community Action on Toxics (ACAT) wrote:

> "The amount of methyl-mercury and other bioaccumulative chemicals
> consumed by Alaskans (especially Alaskan Natives) could potentially be
> much higher than is assumed\...The Alaska Native mortality rate for
> babies which according to the CDC is 70% higher than the United States
> average. Indigenous Arctic & Alaskan Native populations are some of
> the most polluted populations in the world (http://www.amap.no/).
> Global transport & old military sites contaminate us too"

After receiving hundreds of thousands of comments and pressure from
tribal organizations, a revised proposed rule echoed McCausland's
comment noting that "Some subpopulations in the U.S., such as Native
Americans, Southeast Asian Americans, and lower-income subsistence
fishers, may rely on fish as a primary source of nutrition and/or for
cultural practices. Therefore, they consume larger amounts of fish than
the general population and may be at a greater risk of the adverse
health effects from Hg due to increased exposure" (EPA 2004).

After nearly a million additional public comments, a revised proposed
rule ultimately included five pages of analysis of the disparate impacts
on \"vulnerable populations\" including "African Americans," "Hispanic,"
"Native American," and "Other and Multi-racial" groups (EPA 2011). In
the final rule, the language of "vulnerable populations " was replaced
with "minority, low income, and indigenous populations" (EPA 2012). EPA
had also conducted an analysis of sub-populations with particularly high
potential risks exposure due to high rates of fish consumption as well
as an additional analysis of the distribution of mortality risk by to
race.

Of this second round of comments, over 200 explicitly raised the
environmental justice issues. The Little River Band of Ottawa Indians
expressed the Tribe's "frustration at trying to impress upon the EPA the
multiple and profound impacts of mercury contamination from a Tribal
perspective. Not to mention the obligations under treaties to
participate with tribes on a "Government to Government" basis. At
present, no such meetings have occurred in any meaningful manner with
EPA Region V, the EPA National American Indian Environmental Office, nor
the State of Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality." They
conclude that \"Although EPA purported to consider environmental justice
as it developed its "Clean Air Mercury Rule," it failed utterly. In this
rulemaking, EPA perpetuated, rather than ameliorated, a long history of
cultural discrimination against tribes and their members" (Sprague
2011). Did comments like these play a role in EPA's changed analysis of
who Mercury limits should aim to protect?

Given the many potential sources of influence, it may be difficult to
attribute causal effects of particular comments on a given policy.
However, comments may serve as a good proxy for the general mobilization
of groups and individuals around an administrative process, and it is
not clear why EPA would not address environmental justice in the first
draft of a rule and then add it to subsequent drafts in the absence of
activists mobilization. Electoral politics does not offer an easy
explanation. The notice proposing the Mercury Rule was issued by the
Clinton administration, the same administration that issued the
Executive Order on Environmental Justice, and the subsequent drafts that
did address environmental justice issues were published by the Bush
administration, which had a more contentious relationship with
environmental justice advocates, while Republicans controlled both
houses of Congress. The expansion of the analysis from one draft to the
next seems to be in response to activist pressure.


# Measuring Policy Change

Having demostrated that changes in rule text are plausably related to public comments, I assess the overall relationship between comments and policy change. I use two indicators of policy change to model the effect of public comments on policy: *whether* a rule addresses EJ and *how* it addresses EJ. Both measures represent a fairly low bar, indicating whether the agency explicitly paid any attention at all to ej. This is appropriate given that prior research shows little to no effect of public comments from advocacy groups as well as little attention to EJ in particular. 

## Measure 1: Adding Text Addressing EJ to Final Rules

Where draft rules that did not address EJ, I measure whether added "environmental justice" between its draft and final publication. This is usually took the form of the addition of an "E.O.12898 section" to the preable of the final rule where the agency justifies its policy changes. The next most common addition came in the the agency's response to comments, explaining how the rule did not have disportate effects or that they were insignificant. 

Sometimes an agency will respond to a comment and add an 12898 section. For example, the EPA responded to several commenters including Earthjustice, the Central Valley Air Quality Coalition, the Coalition for Clean Air, Central California Environmental Justice Network, and Central California Asthma Collaborative: "EPA agrees it is important to consider environmental justice in our actions and we briefly addressed environmental justice principles in our proposal." EPA had not, as the commenters noted, addressed environmental justice in the proposed rule, which approved California rules regulating particulate matter emissions from construction sites, unpaved roads, and disturbed soils in open and agricultural areas. EPA did add a fairly generic 12898 section to the final rule, but did not substantively change its position. 

Less frequently, an agency may explicitly dismiss a comment and decline to add a 12898 section. For example, responding to a comment on another rule "One commenter stated that EPA failed to comply with Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice...We do not believe that these amendments will have any adverse effects on...minority and low income populations...Owners or operators are still required to develop SSM plans to address emissions...The only difference from current regulations is that the source is not required to follow the plan." (71 FR 20445) As these examples illustrate, agencies may add text addressing environmental justice that would in no way satisfy critics. This meassure merely indicates whether the agency engaged with the claims.

## Measure 2: Changing Text Addressing EJ in Final Rules

Where draft rules did address EJ, I measure whether a rule changed *how* it discussed "environmental justice" between its draft and final publication.^[Occasionally, there is more than one version of a Proposed or Final rule on a rulemaking docket. Here I opt for an inclusive measure of change that counts change from *any* proposed to *any* final rule. This means that if the change occured between the first and second draft of a proposed rule, it is counted as a change. This best capures the concept of rule change. However, estimates are similar if we only count cases where change occured between *every* version of rule.] 
When an agency address EJ in the draft rule, it is almost alwasy in a section about how it addressed E.O.12898. In many cases, much of the text of final rules, incuding 12898 sections remain exactly the same between draft and final versions. 
To measure change, I parse draft and final rules into sentences and identify sentences containing the phrase "environmenal justice." If these sentences are identical, this indicates the agency did not engage with with comments raising EJ concerns.^[An alternative approach would be to parse documents by section and assess whether E.O.12898 sections are identical. Parsing by sentences has two advantages: it is computationally faster, it avoids problems with section numbering and other frustrations with section matching, and it captures attention to EJ outside of this section, especially in the response to comments section. If an agency is paying attention to EJ issues, sentence matching will be most likely to detect it. However, other measures, such as the percent of EJ sentences changed, the percent of words in a 12898 section that changed, or the change in topic proportions [@Judge-Lord2017] could be useful in future work.]
