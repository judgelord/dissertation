## Testing the Theory

### Environmental Justice as a Boundary-drawing Tool

The politics of environmental justice has several convenient properties for studying the policy impact of social movements. First, discourse around policies framed as "environmental" issues are, unlike issues like civil
rights and immigration, inconsistently racialized and, unlike issues
like taxes and spending, inconsistently focused on *distributions* of
costs and benefits. This means that policies may or may not be framed in environmental justice terms. Despite policy almost always having disparate impacts, an "environmental" frame often creates a human-environment distinction and shifts attention to non-human objects such as air, water, food, or landscapes and away from the distribution of access to them or
protection from them when they are contaminated. By focusing on distributions of costs and benefits, fights over EJ analyses differ from more traditional utilitarian or preservationist analyses.


Second, compared to
other ideas around which people mobilize, "environmental justice" is a
fairly distinctive phrase. Most people who use this phrase share a
general definitional foundation. Even attempts to reframe the term (e.g., to focus on class rather than race or jobs rather than health) come about as dialectical moves related to the term's historical uses. Thus, when "environmental justice" appears in a text, it is rarely a coincidence of words; its appearance is a result of the movement or reactions to it.

Third, this phrase appears frequently
when the idea is discussed. There are few synonyms. Groups raising equity concerns on environmental issues commonly use the phrase "environmental justice." Those who use narrower, related terms---including the older concept of "environmental racism" and the newer concept of "climate justice"---almost always use "environmental justice" in their advocacy as well. 


Finally, the term is relevant to rulemaking records in
particular because Executive Order 12898 issued in 1994 by President
Clinton---"Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority
Populations and Low-Income Populations"---directs all agencies to consider EJ implications of their actions and policies. Executive Orders from Presidents Obama and Biden and statements from agency heads in every administration have since interpreted and reinterpreted parts of this Order, all with direct implications for rulemaking. 
This does not mean that all draft or final rules address EJ, but they tend to cite Executive Order 12898 and explicitly discuss
environmental justice when they do. For the same reason, commenters who critique draft rules also cite this Executive Order and use this language. Again, this is true both for movement activists and reactionary efforts to redefine the term.
While EO 12898 does not itself create a right to sue agencies, courts may strike down rules for failing to comply with procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) if the agency fails to "examine the relevant data" or "consider an important aspect of the problem" (*Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.*, 1983). This can include an agency's 12898 EJ analysis: "environmental justice analysis can be reviewed under NEPA and the APA" (*Communities Against Runway Expansion, Inc. v. FAA*, 2004). The legal salience of the phrase "environmental justice" means that advocates attempting to frame policies in distributive terms tend to use the phrase, and agencies also tend to use it if they respond to these concerns.

### Data

To examine whether EJ activists and public pressure campaigns shape policy documents,
I collect the text of all draft rules, public comments, and final rules from regulations.gov. Then, I select rulemaking documents from agencies that published at least one rule explicitly addressing EJ from 1993 to 2020. This yields over 25,000 rulemaking dockets from 40 agencies. 12,257 of these have both a proposed and final rule.^[Some final rules are published without a draft, and some proposed rules are withdrawn or never finalized. Additional descriptives on each type of rule are available in the online appendix.]

Despite E.O. 12898, most rules do not address EJ. Figure \@ref(fig:ej-data) shows that most draft and final rules (about 90%) do not mention "environmental justice." The number of policies that take EJ into account (rather than just mentioning the E.O. 12898) is likely even lower [Gauna2001; @Revez2018]. Interestingly, the total number of final rules and the percent of the total addressing EJ have remained relatively stable for the period where regulations.gov data are complete (after 2005). From 2006 to 2020, these agencies published between 2000 and 3000 final rules per year, of which between 200 and 300 addressed EJ. 

```{r ej-data, fig.cap = "Proposed and Final Rules by Whether they Address Environmental Justice.", out.height = NULL, out.width = "100%", fig.show = "hold"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "ej-data-ejpr-1.png") ) ##  

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "ej-data-ejfr-1.png") ) ## 
```

Even at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), where most policies are clearly framed as "environmental" issues, a consistent minority of rules address EJ. Many agencies that make policy with apparent EJ effects almost never address EJ. These include the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and the Office of Surface Mining (OSM).  A majority of rules addressed EJ only in a few years at a few agencies that publish relatively few rules, including the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), Army Corps of Engineers (COE), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Forest Service (FS), and several Department of Transportation agencies (the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), and Federal Transit Administration (FTA)). Figure \@ref(fig:ej-data-agencies100) shows the number of rulemaking projects over time by whether they ultimately addressed EJ at agencies that either published more than ten rules addressing EJ or receiving over 100 comments raising EJ concerns. 


```{r ej-data-agencies100, fig.cap = "Number of Proposed and Final Rules Addressing Environmental Justice at the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), Army Corps of Engineers (COE), Department of Transportation (DOT), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Federal High Way Administration (FHWA), Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Forest Service (FS), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), National Highway Transportation Saftey Administration (NHTSA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and Office of Surface Mining (OSM)", out.height = NULL, out.width = "100%", fig.show = "hold"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "ej-data-agencies100-1.png") )
```

#### Comments

Figure \@ref(fig:ej-comments) shows the number of comments on each proposed rule published between 1993 and 2020. Light red circles indicate rules where no commenters raised EJ concerns. Dark blue Triangles indicate rules where they did. The bottom row shows the subset of rules where "environmental justice" appeared in neither the draft nor the final rule. The middle row shows rules where "environmental justice" appeared in the final but not the draft. My first analysis compares these two subsets. The top row shows rules where "environmental justice" appeared in both the draft and final rule. My second analysis assesses change in this subset of rules. Predictably, commenters most often raised EJ concerns on rules in the first row, but many rules that did not initially address EJ still received comments raising EJ concerns.

```



#### Interest Groups and Second-order Representation

When lobbying during rulemaking, groups often
make dubious claims to represent broad segments of the public [@Seifter2016UCLA]. Thus, to interpret substantive results or the normative import of any findings in this analysis, it is insufficient to know which groups participate. We also need to know who these groups claim to represent and whether those people are actually involved in the organization's decisions. As Seifter argues: 

> "the expertise a group claims is often based on its ability to convey a particular constituency's perspective, experience, or concerns...A group that does not have or engage with a membership cannot reliably convey those sorts of constituency-based insights. Moreover, even when a group's assertions seem independent of a constituency---say, the results of a scientific study---information about second-order participation matters. Understanding the group's sources, funding, and potential biases is important to assessing the reliability of its information and its contribution to agency expertise" [@Seifter2016UCLA, pg. 1306].


Examining second-order representation is thus required to assess "what contemporary participation does and does not achieve" [@Seifter2016UCLA, pg. 1306]---for example, the extent to which EJ concerns (and any potential policy response) indicate genuine social movement advocacy and influence. Recall that EJ is a contested concept used to evoke different distributive claims by different groups. The prevalence and impact of EJ concerns in the policy process are only meaningful against the backdrop of who exactly is using EJ rhetoric.

I examine who is raising EJ concerns in two ways.
First, I identify the top organizational commenters such as tribes,
businesses, and nonprofits using EJ language
and investigate whom these groups represent. Second, for comments where a
commenter signed their name, I compare surnames to their racial and ethnic identity propensities in the U.S. Census. Together these
two pieces of information allow me to comment on "second-order" representation. This is a proxy for the extent to which public comments are
representative of the groups they claim to represent [@Seifter2016UCLA].

##### Which Organizations Most Often Raise EJ Concerns?

To explore who raises EJ concerns, I first identify the organization behind each comment through a mix of hand-coding and text analysis. This includes organizational comments on signed letterhead and individuals who use the text of a form letter provided by an organization. I then investigated the top 20 organizations that mobilized the most comments (form letters) mentioning "environmental justice" and all organizations that raised EJ concerns on more than one policy.

<!-- TODO insert table -->

The top mobilizer of comments mentioning "environmental justice" between 1993 and 2020 was the Sierra Club, with over 340,000 comments mentioning EJ on dozens of rules. The Sierra Club a membership organization whose members pay dues, elect the leaders of local chapters and have some say in local advocacy efforts. However, its policy work is directed by a more traditional national advocacy organization funded by donations, including over $174 million from Bloomberg Philanthropies that funded several of the public pressure campaigns in these data. The Sierra Club does have a major program arm dedicated to Environmental Justice that works with local partners "to foster the growth of the environmental justice movement so that oppressed communities will find justice and everyone can experience the benefits of a healthy and sustainable future." The extent to which those individuals have a formal say in the national organization's lobbying decisions varies across campaigns. The National Board of Directors adopted a statement on social justice in 1993 and principles on environmental justice in 2001. The national website does contain regular Spanish language content. As a federated organization with many local efforts, it is difficult to generalize about second-order representation.

The second most prolific organizer of EJ comments was Earthjustice, with over 175,000 comments on many of the same rules that the Sierra Club lobbied on. Earthjustice is primarily engaged in litigation on
behalf of environmental causes. Their website boasts 2.2 million
supporters, but it is not clear who they are or if they play any role in
the advocacy strategy. A search on the website returns 360 results for
"Environmental Justice," with the top results from staff biographies
who work on more local or targeted campaigns, such as environmental conditions
for the incarcerated. The EJ language used on the
main page is relatively vague. For example, "We are fighting for a future
where children can breathe clean air, no matter where they live."
[@Earthjustice2017]. The website does contain some Spanish-language content.

The Natural Resources Defense Council is similar to Earthjustice---a
national nonprofit funded by donations and focused on litigation---but
they also lobby and organize public pressure campaigns, including over 160,000 comments mentioning environmental justice. 

CREDO Action and MoveOn are more generic progressive
mobilizers who lack a systematic focus on EJ issues,
but occasionally leverage their vast membership and contact lists to support
EJ campaigns led by others.

The Alliance for Climate Protection is more of an elite political group founded by former Vice President Al Gore. <!-- TODO more-->

We Act and Communities for a Better Environment both have environmental
justice in their central mission statement. Community leaders founded We Act in Harlem, New York, to advocate against environmental racism and poor air quality [@WEACT2017]. Communities for a Better Environment has projects throughout California but is particularly
active in Oakland [@CBECAL2017]. Much of the
content of their website is in both English and Spanish. Both
organizations focus primarily on "low-income communities of color" and frame their work primarily in terms of race and class. While both
organizations participated in national policymaking, We Act is more
focused on communities in Harlem and New York, whereas Communities for a
Better Environment casts a broader frame: "CBE's vision of environmental
justice is global---that's why the organization continues to participate
in such international efforts as the Indigenous Environmental Network
and the Global Week of Action for Climate Justice" [@CBECAL2017].

While not a large portion of EJ comments, companies repeatedly raise research about the unequal impacts of policy to frame these issues as a legitimate but unresolved scientific debate that is not yet conclusive enough to base regulations on, mirroring the way tobacco and fossil fuel companies have emphasized scientific uncertainty in their lobbying efforts.<!--TODO CITE-->
For example, in one comment, the Southern Company wrote:

> "People with lower SES are exposed to almost an order of magnitude
more traffic near their homes (Reynolds et al., 2001), and live closer
to large industrial sites and are exposed to more industrial air
pollution (Jerrett et al., 2001). Legitimate health concerns must be
addressed. But adopting standards with a scientific basis so uncertain
that health improvement cannot be assured is not sound public health
policy." 

Like many companies, they claim to represent their customers:
"electric generating companies and their customers are expected to bear
much of the burden" of regulations [@Hobson2004]. Yet, customers have little say in companies' decisions. 

Overall, regarding second-order representation, it appears that the groups
most often using the language of environmental justice may do so
sincerely but generally represent affected communities in a surrogate capacity [@Mansbridge2003]. Several groups representing local communities and led by community leaders have
participated, but not nearly as often or with the same intensity as the
"big greens." The domination of large advocacy organizations highlights the importance of resources as a condition
for lobbying and mobilizing. Not all groups who may benefit from generating political
information can leverage it because they lack the resources to
fund a campaign or even comment on relevant policies. However, smaller, more
member-driven groups may partner with national groups that have more resources to
mobilize on their behalf. 
Finally, a third, much less common type of commenter raises EJ issues
to reframe them as ongoing debates and thus undermine their
urgency. I call this reason for engaging an attempt to "break a perceived
consensus." In a way, the fact that energy companies felt compelled to
acknowledge and question EJ concerns suggests their
importance for policy outcomes.

##### Commenter Race

To estimate the racial distribution of commenters
using EJ language, I select commenters who
signed with a
surname appearing in census records. Figure
\@ref(fig:ejcommentsbyrace) shows a probabilistic racial
distribution of commenters who raise EJ concerns in
their comments based on the distribution of self-reported racial identities
associated with surnames as recorded in the 2010 census.^[I recode "Hispanic" as "Latinx"] I estimate this distribution using the proportion of people with a given surname identified as belonging to each racial
category (from this limited set of options). This approach does not
assign specific individuals to racial categories. Instead, it represents each commenter as a set of probabilities adding up to 1. The estimated racial distribution of the sample is the sum of individual probabilities.

```{r ejcommentsbyrace, fig.cap = 'Estimated Racial Distribution from Census Surnames of Commenters raising ``Environmental Justice" Concerns in Rulemaking', fig.height = 1.5, fig.width=2, out.width = "45%", fig.show = "hold"}
load(here("data", "ej_race.Rdata"))

Race %>% ggplot() + 
  aes(y =Race, x = Probability) + 
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())
```


Compared to the overall distribution in the 2010 census, this sample of commenters appears to be slightly disproportionately Black and less than proportionately
Latinx or Asian, with just slightly fewer Whites relative to the
national population. This is unsurprising, given that Black Americans have led theorizing and activism around environmental justice
[@Bullard1993].


### Tracing Ideas Through Rulemaking: "Environmental Justice" as a Contested Concept

Using an environmental justice frame does not always imply the same
communities of concern. Environmental justice emerged from movements
against environmental racism, especially the disposal of toxic
materials in predominantly Black neighborhoods [@Bullard1993]. However, the term
quickly took on other meanings, encompassing various marginalized groups. President Clinton's 1994 Executive Order on
Environmental Justice required all parts of the federal government
to make "addressing disproportionately high and adverse human health or
environmental effects of programs, policies, and activities on minority
populations and low-income populations" a core aspect of their mission.
This meant considering the disproportionate effects of policies by race and income during rulemaking.

In 2005, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) political appointees reinterpreted the Order, removing race as a factor in identifying and prioritizing populations. This move was criticized by activists and two reports by EPA's own Office of Inspector General. 

President Obama's EPA Administrators reestablished race as a factor. They named EJ as one of their top priorities, but they also faced criticism from activists for paying lip service to environmental racism without adequate policy changes.

In an October 2017 proposed rule to repeal
restrictions on power plant pollution, the Trump EPA acknowledged that
"low-income and minority communities located in proximity to [power
plants] may have experienced an improvement in air quality as a result
of the emissions reductions." Because the Obama EPA discussed
EJ when promulgating the Clean Power Plan rule (stating that "climate change is an environmental justice issue"), the Trump EPA attempted to reframe rather than ignore environmental justice. The Trump EPA contended that the Obama EPA "did not address lower household energy bills for low-income households [and that] workers losing jobs in regions or occupations with weak labor markets would have been most vulnerable" (EPA 2017). Like regulated industry commenters, these statements frame the distribution of jobs and electricity costs as EJ issues in order to push back against policies that would equalize the distribution of health impacts from pollution. 

The central conflict over the role of race in policy analyses is just one of many conflicts that the environmental justice movement has caused to be fought somewhat on its terms. The next section briefly reviews the decades-long policy fight over regulating Mercury pollution to illustrate how these definitional conflicts shape rules and rulemaking. This case and other examples in this article emerged from reading hundreds of rulemaking documents where agencies did and did not respond to comments raising EJ concerns. Their purpose is to assess whether the cases in the quantitative analysis are plausibly what they appear to be: that changes in rule text are, sometimes, causally related to public comments and that non-changes are cases of agencies disregarding comments, not some accident of the data or measures. 
The qualitative reading also confirmed other key assumptions, such as the fact that advocates do, in fact, use "environmental justice" when they raise distributional concerns, even on many rules that are not about issues traditionally considered "environmental."


#### The Evolving Distributional Politics of Mercury Pollution

Definitions of the public good and minority rights are
implicit in most policy documents, including agency rules. The public comment process offers an
opportunity to protest these definitions. Protest is one way that
marginalized groups can communicate opinions on issues to government
officials [@Gillion2013]. In the EPA's Mercury Rules, two
definitional issues were decisive. First, as with many forms of pollution,
mercury-emitting power plants are concentrated in low-income and
non-White communities. Second, some populations consume much more
locally-caught freshwater fish, a major vector of Mercury toxicity.
Studies inspired by the political controversy around the Mercury Rules
found high risk among certain communities, including "Hispanic, Vietnamese, and
Laotian populations in California and Great Lakes tribal populations
(Chippewa and Ojibwe) active on ceded territories around the Great
Lakes" (EPA 2012). Thus the standards that EPA chooses depend on whom the regulation aims to protect: the average citizen,
local residents, or fishing communities. This decision has disparate
effects based on race and class because of disparate effects based on
geography and cultural practices. 

In December 2000, when the EPA first announced its intention to regulate
Mercury from power plants, the notice published in the Federal Register
did not address EJ issues, such as the disparate
effects of mercury on certain populations; it only discussed anticipated impacts in
reference to "the U.S. population" (EPA 2000). When the first draft rule
was published, it only discussed the effects of the rule on regulated
entities, noting that 

> "Other types of entities not listed could also be
affected" (EPA 2002). 

Commenting on this draft, Heather McCausland of
the Alaska Community Action on Toxics (ACAT) wrote:

> "The amount of methyl-mercury and other bioaccumulative chemicals
> consumed by Alaskans (especially Alaskan Natives) could potentially be
> much higher than is assumed... [This could increase] the Alaskan Native mortality rate for
> babies, which according to the CDC, is 70% higher than the United States
> average. Indigenous Arctic & Alaskan Native populations are some of
> the most polluted populations in the world.
> Global transport & old military sites contaminate us too."

By citing the CDC, McCausland's comment provided both technical and distributive information. As allies mobilized, public pressure mounted to address the disparate impacts of mercury levels.
After receiving hundreds of thousands of comments and pressure from
tribal governments and organizations, a revised proposed rule echoed McCausland's
comment noting that 

> "Some subpopulations in the U.S., such as Native
Americans, Southeast Asian Americans, and lower-income subsistence
fishers may rely on fish as a primary source of nutrition and/or for
cultural practices. Therefore, they consume larger amounts of fish than
the general population and may be at a greater risk of the adverse
health effects from Hg due to increased exposure" (EPA 2004).

After nearly a million additional public comments, a further revised proposed
rule ultimately included five pages of analysis of the disparate impacts
on "vulnerable populations" including "African Americans," "Hispanic,"
"Native American," and "Other and Multi-racial" groups (EPA 2011). In the final rule, "vulnerable populations" was replaced
with "minority, low income, and indigenous populations" (EPA 2012). The EPA
had also conducted an analysis of sub-populations with particularly high
potential risks of exposure due to high rates of fish consumption as well
as additional analysis of the distribution of mortality risk by
race.

Of this second round of comments, over 200 unique comments explicitly raised
EJ issues. The Little River Band of Ottawa Indians
expressed the Tribe's 

> "frustration at trying to impress upon the EPA the
multiple and profound impacts of mercury contamination from a Tribal
perspective. Not to mention the obligations under treaties to
participate with tribes on a 'Government to Government' basis. At
present, no such meetings have occurred in any meaningful manner with
EPA Region V, the EPA National American Indian Environmental Office, nor
the State of Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality...Although EPA purported to consider environmental justice
as it developed its Clean Air Mercury Rule, it failed utterly. In this
rulemaking, the EPA perpetuated, rather than ameliorated, a long history of
cultural discrimination against tribes and their members" (Sprague
2011). 

Did comments like these play a role in EPA's changed analysis of
whom Mercury limits should aim to protect.
Given the many potential sources of influence, it may be difficult to
attribute causal effects of particular comments on a given policy.
However, comments may serve as a good proxy for the general mobilization
of groups and individuals around an administrative process, and it is
not clear why the EPA would not address EJ in the first
draft of a rule and then add it to subsequent drafts in the absence of
activist pressure. Electoral politics does not offer an easy
explanation. The notice proposing the Mercury Rule was issued by the
Clinton administration, the same administration that issued the
Executive Order on Environmental Justice, and the subsequent drafts that
did address EJ issues were published by the Bush
administration, which had a more contentious relationship with
EJ advocates, while Republicans controlled both
houses of Congress. The expansion of the analysis from one draft to the
next seems to be in response to activist pressure.


### Measuring Policy Change

Having shown how public comments and pressure can influence policy texts, I assess the general relationship between comments and policy texts across all rules. I use two indicators of responsiveness to model the effect of public comments on policy documents: *whether* a rule addresses EJ and change in *how* it addresses EJ, i.e., change in portions of the text discussing EJ. Both measures represent a relatively low bar, indicating whether the agency explicitly paid any attention to EJ. This is similar to measures of "procedural responsiveness" used by @Balla2020. The low empirical bar is appropriate given that prior research, including the previous chapter in this dissertation, shows little to no effect of public comments from advocacy groups [@Yackee2006JOP; @Balla2020] and low levels of attention to EJ concerns in particular (Figure \@ref(fig:ej-data)). <!--[@Hughes2020].-->

Examples in the previous section illustrate how text mentioning "environmental justice" might be added or change. Carefully tracing a few rulemaking processes also helped to avoid analytic pitfalls. For example, one case where an agency did an EJ analysis and then appeared not to respond to a comment discussing EJ was, in fact, due to the fact that the commenter included an annotated version of the draft rule their comment, adding only "no comment" next to the 12898 section. To correct this, I removed text copied from the proposed rule from comments in pre-processing. 

#### Measure 1: Adding Text Addressing EJ to Final Rules

For the subset of draft rules that did not address EJ, I measure whether agencies added any mention of "environmental justice" in the final rule. Such additions usually take the form of an "E.O. 12898" section where the agency justifies its policy changes with respect to some concept(s) of environmental justice. The next most common addition occurs in the agency's response to comments, explaining how the rule did not have disparate effects or that they were insignificant.

Agencies may both respond to a comment and add a 12898 section. For example, the EPA responded to several commenters, including Earthjustice, the Central Valley Air Quality Coalition, the Coalition for Clean Air, Central California Environmental Justice Network, and Central California Asthma Collaborative: "EPA agrees it is important to consider environmental justice in our actions and we briefly addressed environmental justice principles in our proposal." As the commenters noted, the EPA had not, in fact, addressed environmental justice in the proposed rule, which approved California rules regulating particulate matter emissions from construction sites, unpaved roads, and disturbed soils in open and agricultural areas. EPA did add a fairly generic 12898 section to the final rule but did not substantively change the rest of the policy. 

Less frequently, an agency may explicitly dismiss a comment and decline to add a 12898 section. For example, EPA responded to a comment on another rule, "One commenter stated that EPA failed to comply with Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice...We do not believe that these amendments will have any adverse effects on...minority and low-income populations...Owners or operators are still required to develop SSM plans to address emissions...The only difference from current regulations is that the source is not required to follow the plan" (71 FR 20445). As these examples illustrate, agencies may add text addressing environmental justice that would not satisfy critics. This measure merely indicates whether the agency engaged with the claims.

<!--Barry: you say that change between draft and final rules is the evidence that the agency "engaged" with EJ comments. But I don't think that's quite right. The agency might have engaged heavily but decided that the draft rule was fine. It's really whether the comments persuaded them that a change was necessary.-->

Most frequently, agencies neither responded to comments nor added a 12898 section.

#### Measure 2: Changing Text Addressing EJ in Final Rules

Where draft rules did address EJ, I measured whether a rule changed *how* it discussed "environmental justice" between its draft and final publication.^[Occasionally, there is more than one version of a proposed or final rule on a rulemaking docket. Here I opt for an inclusive measure of change that counts change from *any* proposed to *any* final rule. If the change occurred between the first and second draft of a proposed rule, I count it as a change. This best captures the concept of rule change. However, estimates are similar if we only count cases where a change occurred between *every* version of the rule.] 
When an agency addresses EJ in the draft rule, it is almost always in a section about how it addressed E.O. 12898. In many cases, much of the text of final rules, including 12898 sections, remain exactly the same between draft and final versions. 
To measure change, I parse draft and final rules into sentences and identify sentences containing the phrase "environmental justice." If an agency leaves these sentences unchanged between the draft and final rule and adds no new sentences mentioning EJ, this suggests that the agency did not engage with comments raising EJ concerns.^[An alternative approach would be to parse documents by section and assess whether E.O.12898 sections are identical. Parsing by sentences has three advantages: it is computationally faster, it avoids problems with section numbering and other frustrations with section matching, and it captures attention to EJ outside of this section, especially in the section responding to comments. If an agency is paying attention to EJ issues, sentence matching will likely detect it. However, other measures, such as the percent of EJ sentences changed, the percent of words in a 12898 section that changed, or the change in topic proportions [@Judge-Lord2017], could be useful in future work.]
