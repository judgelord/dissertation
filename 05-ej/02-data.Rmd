## Data and Methods

<!--TODO 
I estimate ten topics models 
then select the topics positively correlated with EJ and subset to documents that are (high?) in one or more of those topics. Where one of those topics is prominent (top 50% of document proportions) 
this addresses historical patterns. Many of these topics are correlated with agency 
I estimate at least 50 topics to allow for an agency-specific topic. Still, ej-correlated topics are partially topics associated with agencies that address EJ.

### The Environmental Justice Frame

The environmental justice frame has several convenient properties for studying the policy impact of political movements. First, discourse around policies framed as environmental issues is inconsistently racialized  (unlike civil rights and immigration policies) and inconsistently focused on *distributions* of costs and benefits (unlike debates over taxes and spending, for example). Indeed, White environmentalists often frame environmental policy as public good provision, thereby deemphasizing distributive conflict. This means that policies may or may not be framed in EJ terms. Despite policy almost always having disparate impacts, an "environmental" frame often creates a human-environment distinction and shifts attention to non-human objects such as air, water, food, or landscapes and away from the distribution of access to them or
protection from them when they are contaminated. By focusing on distributions of costs and benefits, EJ analyses differ from the more utilitarian or preservationist analyses that dominate White environmental activism and policymaking [@Harrison2019].


Second, compared to other ideas around which people mobilize, "environmental justice" is a fairly distinctive phrase. Most people who use this term share a broad definitional foundation. Even attempts to reframe the term (e.g., to focus on class more than race or jobs more than health) come about as dialectical responses to the term's historical uses. Thus, when "environmental justice" appears in a text, it is rarely a coincidence; its appearance can be attributed to the movement or reactions to it.

Third, this phrase appears frequently when the idea is discussed. There are few synonyms. Groups raising equity concerns on environmental issues commonly use the phrase "environmental justice." Those who use narrower, related terms---including the older frame of "environmental racism" and the newer frame of "climate justice"---almost always mention "environmental justice" as well. 

Finally, the term is relevant to rulemaking in particular due to President Clinton's Executive Order 12898---"Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations"---directing all agencies to consider EJ implications of their actions and policies. Executive Orders or statements from agency heads in every administration have since interpreted and reinterpreted parts of E.O. 12898, all with direct implications for rulemaking. 
Despite this Executive Order, not all draft or final rules address EJ. Those that do, however, tend to cite E.O. 12898 and use the phrase "environmental justice." For the same reason, commenters who critique draft rules also cite E.O. 12898 and use this language. Again, this is true both for movement activists and reactionary efforts to redefine the term.
```{asis, eval = book, include = book}
While E.O. 12898 does not itself create a right to sue agencies, courts may strike down rules for failing to comply with procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) if the agency fails to "examine the relevant data" or "consider an important aspect of the problem" (*Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.*, 1983). This can include an agency's 12898 EJ analysis: "environmental justice analysis can be reviewed under NEPA and the APA" (*Communities Against Runway Expansion, Inc. v. FAA*, 2004). 
``` 
While there is no formal legal requirement for agencies to comply with E.O. 12898 (and, as Figure \@ref(fig:ej-data) shows, they rarely do), the legal salience of the phrase "environmental justice" means that advocates attempting to frame policies in distributive terms tend to use this distinctive phrase, and agencies also tend to use it if they respond to these concerns.


### Data: Policy Texts and Public Comments

To examine the impact of EJ activists and public pressure campaigns on policy documents,
I collect the text of all draft rules, public comments, and final rules from regulations.gov. Then, I select rulemaking documents from agencies that published at least one rule explicitly addressing EJ from 1993 to 2020. This yields 26,670 rulemaking dockets from 40 agencies; 13,179 of these have both a proposed and final rule, allowing me to assess change in relation to comments.^[Some final rules are published without a draft, and some proposed rules are withdrawn or never finalized.<!--Additional descriptives on each type of rule are available in the online appendix.-->]

Despite E.O. 12898, most rules do not address environmental justice. Most draft and final rules do not mention "environmental justice." The number of policies that take EJ into account (rather than just mentioning the E.O. 12898) is even lower [@Gauna2001; @Revez2018]. Interestingly, the total number of final rules and the percent of the total addressing EJ have remained relatively stable for the period where regulations.gov data are complete (after 2005).^[See Figure \@ref(fig:ej-data-long) for the full time period] Figure \@ref(fig:ej-data) shows that from 2006 to 2020, these agencies published between 1,300 and 1,885 final rules per year, of which less than 15 percent addressed EJ. 

```{r ej-data, fig.cap = "Proposed and Final Rules by Whether They Address Environmental Justice",  out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "ej-data-4.png") ) ##
```

 Figure \@ref(fig:ej-data-agencies100) shows the number of rulemaking dockets over time by whether they ultimately addressed EJ at agencies that either published more than ten rules addressing EJ or received over 100 comments raising EJ concerns. Even at the EPA, where most policies are clearly framed as "environmental" issues, only about half of final rules address EJ. Many agencies that make policies with apparent EJ effects rarely address EJ (e.g., the Office of Surface Mining (OSM) and Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)). At no agency did a majority of rules address EJ overall. Only in a handful of years at agencies that publish few rules was EJ addressed in most rules.

```

#### Comments

Figure \@ref(fig:ej-comments) shows the number of comments on each proposed rule published between 1993 and 2020. Circles indicate rules where no commenters raised EJ concerns. Triangles indicate rules where they did. The bottom row shows the subset of rules where "environmental justice" appeared in neither the draft nor the final rule. The middle row shows rules in which "environmental justice" appeared in the final but not the draft. My first analysis compares these two subsets. The top row shows rules where "environmental justice" appeared in both the draft and final rule. My second analysis assesses change in this subset of rules. Predictably, commenters most often raised EJ concerns on rules in the first row, but many rules that did not initially address EJ still received comments raising EJ concerns.
For the statistical analysis, I distinguish unique comments from mass comments. The number of unique comments approximates a coalition's size regarding the number of different groups, each submitting a unique text. The total number of comments, including signatures on identical form letters, indicates the scale of public attention and pressure.

```



#### Interest Groups and Second-order Representation

When lobbying during rulemaking, groups often claim to represent broader movements and segments of the public---claims which are often dubious and difficult to verify [@Seifter2016UCLA]. We cannot assume that a group's lobbying success is a win for the people they claim to represent. Interpreting the substantive results or normative import of any findings in this analysis thus requires caution. It is insufficient to know which groups participate. We also need to know who these groups claim to represent and whether the people they claim to represent are involved in the organization's decisions. As Seifter argues, "the expertise a group claims is often based on its ability to convey a particular constituency's perspective, experience, or concerns...A group that does not have or engage with a membership cannot reliably convey those sorts of constituency-based insights."  [@Seifter2016UCLA, p. 1306].

Examining second-order representation is thus required to assess "what contemporary participation does and does not achieve" [@Seifter2016UCLA, pg. 1306]---for example, the extent to which EJ concerns (and any potential policy response) indicate genuine movement advocacy and influence. Recall that EJ is a contested concept used to evoke different distributive claims by different groups. The prevalence and impact of EJ concerns in the policy process are only meaningful against the backdrop of who exactly is using EJ rhetoric.

I examine who is raising EJ concerns in two ways.
First, I identify the top organizational commenters such as tribes,
businesses, and nonprofits using EJ language
and investigate whom these groups represent. I then use a hand-coded sample of 10,000 organizational comments on a random sample of rules to assess which types of organizations get the substantive policy changes they request when raising EJ concerns.
Second, for comments where commenters signed their name, I compare surnames to their racial and ethnic identity propensities in the U.S. Census. Together these pieces of information allow me to comment on "second-order" representation. This is a proxy for the extent to which public comments are
representative of the groups they claim to represent [@Seifter2016UCLA].

##### Which Organizations Most Often Raise EJ Concerns?

To explore who raises EJ concerns, I first identify the organization behind each comment through an iterative process of hand-coding and text analysis. This includes organizational comments on signed letterhead and individuals who use the text of a form letter provided by an organization. I then investigated all organizations that raised EJ concerns on more than one policy. <!--these comments represent XX percent of all comments raising EJ--> 

```{r ejorgs}
load(here::here("data", "ejorgs_summary.Rdata"))

ejorgs_summary  |>
  filter(Organization != "Individual") |>

```

Table \@ref(tab:ejorgs) shows the organizations that raised environmental justice in comments on the most proposed rules between 1993 and 2020. By total number of comments, the top mobilizer was the Sierra Club, with over 340,000 comments mentioning EJ on dozens of rules. The Sierra Club is a membership organization whose members pay dues, elect the leaders of local chapters and have some say in local advocacy efforts. However, its policy work is directed by a more traditional national advocacy organization funded by donations, including over $174 million from Bloomberg Philanthropies, which funded several of the public pressure campaigns in these data. The Sierra Club has a major program arm dedicated to Environmental Justice that works with local partners "to foster the growth of the environmental justice movement so that oppressed communities will find justice and everyone can experience the benefits of a healthy and sustainable future."
<!--[@SierraEJ]-->
As a federated organization with many local efforts, it is difficult to generalize about second-order representation.
The extent to which EJ communities have a formal say in the national organization's lobbying decisions varies across campaigns. The National Board of Directors adopted a statement on social justice in 1993 and principles on environmental justice in 2001. The national website contains regular Spanish-language content, demonstrating that the organization makes an effort toward increasing language accessibility. 

Earthjustice was the second most prolific organizer of EJ comments, with over 175,000 comments on many of the same rules that the Sierra Club lobbied on. Earthjustice is primarily engaged in litigation on
behalf of environmental causes. Their website boasts 2.2 million
supporters, but it is not clear who they are or if they play any role in advocacy strategy. A search on the website returns hundreds of results for "Environmental Justice," with the top results from staff biographies who work on more local or targeted campaigns, such as environmental conditions for the incarcerated. <!--The EJ language used on the main page is relatively vague. For example, "We are fighting for a future where children can breathe clean air, no matter where they live."
<!--[@Earthjustice2017]. -->
The website contains some Spanish-language content.
The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) is similar to Earthjustice---a national nonprofit funded by donations and focused on litigation---but they also lobby and organize public pressure campaigns, including over 160,000 comments mentioning environmental justice. 

CREDO Action, PEW, and MoveOn are more generic progressive
mobilizers who lack a systematic focus on EJ issues,
but occasionally leverage their vast membership and contact lists to support EJ campaigns led by others.

While not a large portion of EJ comments, private companies repeatedly raise research about the unequal impacts of policy to frame these issues as a legitimate but unresolved scientific debate that is not yet conclusive enough to base regulations on, mirroring the way tobacco and fossil fuel companies have emphasized scientific uncertainty in their lobbying efforts [@Oreskes2011].
<!--TODO CITE-->
For example, in one comment, the Southern Company wrote:

> People with lower SES are exposed to almost an order of magnitude
more traffic near their homes (Reynolds et al., 2001), and live closer to large industrial sites and are exposed to more industrial air pollution (Jerrett et al., 2001). Legitimate health concerns must be addressed. But adopting standards with a scientific basis so uncertain that health improvement cannot be assured is not sound public health policy. ([EPA-HQ-OAR-2004-0018-0211](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2004-0018-0211))^[All primary documents cited are available on regulations.gov.]

<!-- alt cite [@Hobson2004]-->

Other electric utility companies and the American Chemistry Council (the Chemical Industry’s Trade Association) submitted nearly identical language on multiple proposed rules. Like many companies, the Southern Company claimed to represent its customers:
"electric generating companies and their customers are expected to bear
much of the burden" of regulations ([EPA-HQ-OAR-2004-0018-0211](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2004-0018-0211)). Yet, customers have little say in companies' decisions. 

Overall, regarding second-order representation, it appears that the groups
most often using the language of environmental justice may do so
sincerely but generally represent affected communities in a surrogate capacity [@Mansbridge2003]. Several groups representing local communities and led by community leaders have participated, but not nearly as often or with the same intensity as the
"big greens." The domination of large advocacy organizations highlights the importance of resources as a condition for lobbying and mobilizing. Not all groups that may benefit from generating political information can leverage it because they lack the resources to fund a campaign or even comment on relevant policies. However, smaller, more member-driven groups may partner with national groups with more resources to mobilize on their behalf. Finally, a third, much less common type of commenter raises EJ issues to reframe them as ongoing debates and thus undermine their urgency. 
Though this strategy is intended to undermine EJ efforts, the fact that energy companies felt compelled to acknowledge and question EJ concerns suggests their importance for policy outcomes.


##### Commenter Race

To estimate the racial distribution of commenters
using EJ language, I select commenters who
signed with a
surname appearing in Census records. Figure
\@ref(fig:ejcommentsbyrace) shows a probabilistic racial
distribution of commenters who raise EJ concerns in
their comments based on the distribution of self-reported racial identities
associated with surnames as recorded in the 2010 census.^[I recode "Hispanic" as "Latinx."] I estimate this distribution using the proportion of people with a given surname identified as belonging to each racial
category (from this limited set of options). This approach does not
assign specific individuals to racial categories. Instead, it represents each commenter as a set of probabilities adding up to 1. The estimated racial distribution of the sample is the sum of individual probabilities.

```{r ejcommentsbyrace, fig.cap = 'Estimated Racial Distribution from Census Surnames of Commenters raising ``Environmental Justice" Concerns in Rulemaking', fig.height = 1.5, fig.width=2, out.width = "40%", fig.show = "hold"}
load(here::here("data", "ej_race.Rdata"))

Race %>% ggplot() + 
  aes(y =Race, x = Probability) + 
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) +
  labs(x = "Sum of Probability Across EJ Commentors")
```


Compared to the overall distribution in the 2010 census, this sample of commenters appears to be slightly disproportionately Black and less than proportionately
Latinx or Asian, with slightly fewer Whites relative to the
national population. This is unsurprising, given that Black Americans have led theorizing and activism around environmental justice
[@Bullard1993].



```{r child = if (book) here::here("05-ej", "ej-tracing.Rmd")}
```



### Measuring Policy Change {#ej-methods}

```{asis, eval = book, include = book}
Examples in the previous section illustrate how text mentioning "environmental justice" might be added or changed. ^[Carefully tracing a few rulemaking processes also helped to avoid analytic pitfalls. For example, one case where an agency did an EJ analysis and then appeared not to respond to a comment discussing EJ was, in fact, because the commenter included an annotated version of the draft rule in their comment, adding only "no comment" next to the 12898 section. To correct this, I removed text copied from the proposed rule from comments in pre-processing.]
Having shown how public comments and pressure can influence policy texts, this section assesses the general relationship between comments and policy texts across all rules. 
```

I use two indicators of responsiveness to model the effect of public comments on policy documents: *whether* a policy addresses EJ and change in *how* it addresses EJ, i.e., change in portions of the text discussing EJ. Both measures indicate whether agency officials explicitly paid attention to EJ as they revised the rule. This is similar to measures of "procedural responsiveness" used by @Balla2020. Recall from Figure \@ref(fig:ej-data) that only 10% of proposed or final rules from these agencies mention environmental justice at all. <!--[@Hughes2020].-->



#### Measure 1: Adding Text Addressing EJ to Final Rules

For the subset of draft rules that did not address EJ, I measure whether agencies added any mention of "environmental justice" in the final rule. Such additions usually take the form of an "E.O. 12898" section where the agency justifies its policy changes using some concept(s) of EJ. The next most common addition occurs in the agency's response to comments, explaining how the rule did not have disparate effects or that they were insignificant.

Agencies may both respond to a comment and add a 12898 section. For example, the EPA responded to several commenters, including Earthjustice, the Central Valley Air Quality Coalition, the Coalition for Clean Air, Central California Environmental Justice Network, and Central California Asthma Collaborative: "EPA agrees it is important to consider environmental justice in our actions and we briefly addressed environmental justice principles in our proposal." As the commenters noted, the EPA had not addressed EJ in the proposed rule, which approved California rules regulating particulate matter emissions from construction sites, unpaved roads, and disturbed soils in open and agricultural areas. EPA did add a fairly generic 12898 section to the final rule but did not substantively change the rest of the policy. 

Less frequently, an agency may explicitly dismiss a comment and decline to add a 12898 section. For example, the G.W. Bush EPA responded to a comment on another rule, "One commenter stated that EPA failed to comply with Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice...We do not believe that these amendments will have any adverse effects on...minority and low-income populations...Owners or operators are still required to develop SSM plans to address emissions...The only difference from current regulations is that the source is not required to follow the plan" (71 FR 20445). As these examples illustrate, agencies may add text addressing EJ that would not satisfy critics. This measure merely indicates whether the agency engaged with the claims.

<!--Barry: you say that the change between draft and final rules is evidence that the agency "engaged" with EJ comments. But I don't think that's quite right. The agency might have engaged heavily but decided that the draft rule was fine. It's really whether the comments persuaded them that a change was necessary.-->

Most frequently, agencies neither responded to comments nor added a 12898 section.

#### Measure 2: Changing Text Addressing EJ in Final Rules

Where draft rules did address EJ, I assessed whether a rule changed *how* it discussed environmental justice between its draft and final publication.^[Occasionally, there is more than one version of a proposed or final rule on a rulemaking docket. Here I opt for an inclusive measure of change that counts change from *any* proposed to *any* final rule. If the change occurred between the first and second draft of a proposed rule, I count it as a change. This best captures the concept of rule change. However, estimates are similar if we only count cases where a change occurred between *every* version of the rule.] 
When an agency addresses EJ in the draft rule, it is almost always in a section about how it addressed E.O. 12898.^[E.O. 12898 sections and other text mentioning environmental justice sometimes assert that the policy has no disproportionate impacts on EJ communities. Comments raising environmental justice concerns typically challenge such assertions. If agency officials decline to change their text and add no new sentences about environmental justice, this indicates they likely ignored any comments raising distributive justice claims. If officials change or add language on EJ---even in a revised dismissal of distributive justice claims---it is more likely that they engaged with commenters.] 
In many cases, much of the text of final rules, including 12898 sections, remains exactly the same between draft and final versions. 
To measure change, I parse draft and final rules into sentences and identify sentences containing the phrase "environmental justice." If an agency leaves these sentences unchanged between the draft and final rule and adds no new sentences mentioning EJ, this suggests that the agency did not engage with comments raising EJ concerns.^[
An alternative approach would be to parse documents by section and assess whether E.O.12898 sections are identical. Parsing by sentences has three advantages: it is computationally faster, it avoids problems with changes in section numbering and other frustrations with section matching, and it captures attention to EJ outside of the 12898 section, especially in the section responding to comments. If an agency is paying attention to EJ issues, sentence matching will likely detect it. 
```{asis, eval = book, include = book}
However, other measures, such as the percent of EJ sentences changed, the percent of words in a 12898 section that changed, or the change in topic proportions [@Judge-Lord2017], could be useful in future work.
```

Figure \@ref(fig:ej-pairs) shows the draft and final rule pairs used in each measure, with Measure 1 leveraging variation in final rules where the draft contained no mention of EJ and Measure 2 leveraging variation in the text addressing EJ when the draft did address EJ. Circles indicate that "environmental justice" appeared in the text. Triangles indicate that it did not. Solid lines indicate change in rule text; dashed lines indicate no change (one and zero, respectively, for the dependent variable). For visual clarity, draft and final rules are grouped by year---each point may represent hundreds of draft or final rules published that year. In the models, the president variable corresponds to the date the final rule is published since this is the administration in power when the decision to change or not change the rule text is finalized.
