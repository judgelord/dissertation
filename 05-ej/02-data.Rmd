### Environmental Justice as a Boundary-drawing Tool

The politics of environmental justice has several convenient properties for studying the policy impact of political movements. First, discourse around policies framed as environmental issues is (unlike issues like civil rights and immigration) inconsistently racialized and (unlike issues like taxes and spending) inconsistently focused on *distributions* of costs and benefits. Indeed, White environmentalists have long framed environmental policy as public good provision, thereby suppressing distributive conflict. This means that policies may or may not be framed in EJ terms. Despite policy almost always having disparate impacts, an "environmental" frame often creates a human-environment distinction and shifts attention to non-human objects such as air, water, food, or landscapes and away from the distribution of access to them or
protection from them when they are contaminated. By focusing on distributions of costs and benefits, EJ analyses differ from the more utilitarian or preservationist analyses that dominate White environmental activism and policymaking [@Harrison2019].


Second, compared to
other ideas around which people mobilize, "environmental justice" is a fairly distinctive phrase. Most people who use this term share a general definitional foundation. Even attempts to reframe the term (e.g., to focus on class more than race, or jobs more than health) come about as dialectical responses to the term's historical uses. Thus, when "environmental justice" appears in a text, it is rarely a coincidence; its appearance is a result of the movement or reactions to it.

Third, this phrase appears frequently
when the idea is discussed. There are few synonyms. Groups raising equity concerns on environmental issues commonly use the phrase "environmental justice." Those who use narrower, related terms---including the older frame of "environmental racism" and the newer frame of "climate justice"---almost always use "environmental justice" in their advocacy as well. 

Finally, the term is relevant to rulemaking records in particular due to President Clinton's Executive Order 12898---"Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations"---directing all agencies to consider EJ implications of their actions and policies. Executive Orders or statements from agency heads in every administration have since interpreted and reinterpreted parts of E.O. 12898, all with direct implications for rulemaking. 
Despite this Executive Order, not all draft or final rules address EJ. Those that do, however, tend to cite E.O. 12898 and use the phrase "environmental justice." For the same reason, commenters who critique draft rules also cite this Executive Order and use this language. Again, this is true both for movement activists and reactionary efforts to redefine the term.
```{asis eval = book}
While E.O. 12898 does not itself create a right to sue agencies, courts may strike down rules for failing to comply with procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) if the agency fails to "examine the relevant data" or "consider an important aspect of the problem" (*Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.*, 1983). This can include an agency's 12898 EJ analysis: "environmental justice analysis can be reviewed under NEPA and the APA" (*Communities Against Runway Expansion, Inc. v. FAA*, 2004). 
``` 
The legal salience of the phrase "environmental justice" means that advocates attempting to frame policies in distributive terms tend to use the phrase, and agencies also tend to use it if they respond to these concerns.

### Data

To examine the impact of EJ activists and public pressure campaigns on policy documents,
I collect the text of all draft rules, public comments, and final rules from regulations.gov. Then, I select rulemaking documents from agencies that published at least one rule explicitly addressing EJ from 1993 to 2020. This yields 26,670 rulemaking dockets from 40 agencies; 13,179 of these have both a proposed and final rule, allowing me to assess change in relation to comments.^[Some final rules are published without a draft, and some proposed rules are withdrawn or never finalized.<!--Additional descriptives on each type of rule are available in the online appendix.-->]

Despite E.O. 12898, most rules do not address environmental justice. Most draft and final rules (about 90 percent) do not mention "environmental justice." The number of policies that take EJ into account (rather than just mentioning the E.O. 12898) is even lower [@Gauna2001; @Revez2018]. Interestingly, the total number of final rules and the percent of the total addressing EJ have remained relatively stable for the period where regulations.gov data are complete (after 2005). Figure \@ref(fig:ej-data) shows that from 2006 to 2020, these agencies published between 1,300 and 1,885 final rules per year, of which less than 10 percent addressed EJ. 

```{r ej-data, fig.cap = "Proposed and Final Rules by Whether they Address Environmental Justice.", out.height = NULL, out.width = "100%", fig.show = "hold"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "ej-data-ejpr-1.png") ) ##  

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "ej-data-ejfr-1.png") ) ## 
```

 Figure \@ref(fig:ej-data-agencies100) shows the number of rulemaking dockets over time by whether they ultimately addressed EJ at agencies that either published more than ten rules addressing EJ or received over 100 comments raising EJ concerns. Even at the EPA, where most policies are clearly framed as "environmental" issues, only about half of final rules address EJ. Many agencies that make policy with apparent EJ effects almost never address EJ (e.g., the Office of Surface Mining (OSM) and Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)). At no agency did a majority of rules address EJ overall. Only in a handful of years at agencies that publish few rules was EJ addressed in most rules.



```{r ej-data-agencies100, fig.cap = "Number of Final Rules Addressing Environmental Justice", out.height = NULL, out.width = "100%", fig.show = "hold"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "ej-data-agencies100-1.png") )
```

#### Comments

Figure \@ref(fig:ej-comments) shows the number of comments on each proposed rule published between 1993 and 2020. Circles indicate rules where no commenters raised EJ concerns. Triangles indicate rules where they did. The bottom row shows the subset of rules where "environmental justice" appeared in neither the draft nor the final rule. The middle row shows rules in which "environmental justice" appeared in the final but not the draft. My first analysis compares these two subsets. The top row shows rules where "environmental justice" appeared in both the draft and final rule. My second analysis assesses change in this subset of rules. Predictably, commenters most often raised EJ concerns on rules in the first row, but many rules that did not initially address EJ still received comments raising EJ concerns.
For the statistical analysis, I distinguish unique comments from mass comments. The number of unique comments approximates a coalition's size regarding the number of different groups, each submitting a unique text. The total number of comments, including signatures on identical form letters, indicates the scale of public attention and pressure.

```



#### Interest Groups and Second-order Representation

When lobbying during rulemaking, groups often claim to represent broader movements and segments of the public---claims which are often dubious and difficult to verify [@Seifter2016UCLA]. We cannot assume that a group's lobbying success is a win for the people they claim to represent. Interpreting the substantive results or normative import of any findings in this analysis thus requires caution. It is insufficient to know which groups participate. We also need to know who these groups claim to represent and whether the people they claim to represent are actually involved in the organization's decisions. As Seifter argues, "the expertise a group claims is often based on its ability to convey a particular constituency's perspective, experience, or concerns...A group that does not have or engage with a membership cannot reliably convey those sorts of constituency-based insights."  [@Seifter2016UCLA, p. 1306].

Examining second-order representation is thus required to assess "what contemporary participation does and does not achieve" [@Seifter2016UCLA, pg. 1306]---for example, the extent to which EJ concerns (and any potential policy response) indicate genuine  movement advocacy and influence. Recall that EJ is a contested concept used to evoke different distributive claims by different groups. The prevalence and impact of EJ concerns in the policy process are only meaningful against the backdrop of who exactly is using EJ rhetoric.

I examine who is raising EJ concerns in two ways.
First, I identify the top organizational commenters such as tribes,
businesses, and nonprofits using EJ language
and investigate whom these groups represent. I then use a hand-coded sample of 10,000 organizational comments to assess which types of organizations get the substantive policy changes they request when raising EJ concerns.
Second, for comments where commenters signed their name, I compare surnames to their racial and ethnic identity propensities in the U.S. Census. Together these pieces of information allow me to comment on "second-order" representation. This is a proxy for the extent to which public comments are
representative of the groups they claim to represent [@Seifter2016UCLA].

##### Which Organizations Most Often Raise EJ Concerns?

To explore who raises EJ concerns, I first identify the organization behind each comment through a mix of hand-coding and text analysis. This includes organizational comments on signed letterhead and individuals who use the text of a form letter provided by an organization. I then investigate the top 20 organizations that mobilized the most comments (including form letters and petitions) mentioning "environmental justice" and all organizations that raised EJ concerns on more than one policy. <!--these comments represent XX percent of all comments raising EJ--> 

```{r ejorgs}
load(here::here("data", "ejorgs_summary.Rdata"))

#ls()
ejorgs_summary  %>%
  filter(Organization != "Individual") %>% 
  kable3(caption = "Organizations Raising Environmental Justice Concerns on the Most Rulemaking Dockets 2005-2020")
```

Table \@ref(tab:ejorgs) shows the organizations that raised environmental justice in comments on the most proposed rules between 1993 and 2020. In terms of a total number of comments, the top mobilizer was the Sierra Club, with over 340,000 comments mentioning EJ on dozens of rules. The Sierra Club is a membership organization whose members pay dues, elect the leaders of local chapters and have some say in local advocacy efforts. However, its policy work is directed by a more traditional national advocacy organization funded by donations, including over $174 million from Bloomberg Philanthropies that funded several of the public pressure campaigns in these data. The Sierra Club does have a major program arm dedicated to Environmental Justice that works with local partners "to foster the growth of the environmental justice movement so that oppressed communities will find justice and everyone can experience the benefits of a healthy and sustainable future"
<!--[@SierraEJ]-->
The extent to which those individuals have a formal say in the national organization's lobbying decisions varies across campaigns. The National Board of Directors adopted a statement on social justice in 1993 and principles on environmental justice in 2001. The national website contains regular Spanish language content, demonstrating that the organization makes an effort toward increasing language accessibility, but it is difficult to know how often this Spanish-language content is read. . As a federated organization with many local efforts, it is difficult to generalize about second-order representation.

The second most prolific organizer of EJ comments was Earthjustice, with over 175,000 comments on many of the same rules that the Sierra Club lobbied on. Earthjustice is primarily engaged in litigation on
behalf of environmental causes. Their website boasts 2.2 million
supporters, but it is not clear who they are or if they play any role in
the advocacy strategy. A search on the website returns 360 results for
"Environmental Justice," with the top results from staff biographies
who work on more local or targeted campaigns, such as environmental conditions
for the incarcerated. The EJ language used on the
main page is relatively vague. For example, "We are fighting for a future
where children can breathe clean air, no matter where they live."
<!--[@Earthjustice2017]. -->
The website contains some Spanish-language content.
The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) is similar to Earthjustice---a
national nonprofit funded by donations and focused on litigation---but
they also lobby and organize public pressure campaigns, including over 160,000 comments mentioning environmental justice. 

CREDO Action, PEW, and MoveOn are more generic progressive
mobilizers who lack a systematic focus on EJ issues,
but occasionally leverage their vast membership and contact lists to support
EJ campaigns led by others.

While not a large portion of EJ comments, private companies repeatedly raise research about the unequal impacts of policy to frame these issues as a legitimate but unresolved scientific debate that is not yet conclusive enough to base regulations on, mirroring the way tobacco and fossil fuel companies have emphasized scientific uncertainty in their lobbying efforts [Oreskes2011].
<!--TODO CITE-->
For example, in one comment, the Southern Company wrote:

> People with lower SES are exposed to almost an order of magnitude
more traffic near their homes (Reynolds et al., 2001), and live closer
to large industrial sites and are exposed to more industrial air
pollution (Jerrett et al., 2001). Legitimate health concerns must be
addressed. But adopting standards with a scientific basis so uncertain
that health improvement cannot be assured is not sound public health
policy. ([EPA-HQ-OAR-2004-0018-0211](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2004-0018-0211))

<!-- alt cite [@Hobson2004]-->

Other electric utility companies and the American Chemistry Council (the Chemical Industry’s Trade Association) submitted nearly identical language on multiple proposed rules. Like many companies, the Southern Company claimed to represent its customers:
"electric generating companies and their customers are expected to bear
much of the burden" of regulations ([EPA-HQ-OAR-2004-0018-0211](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2004-0018-0211)). Yet, customers have little say in companies' decisions. 

Overall, regarding second-order representation, it appears that the groups
most often using the language of environmental justice may do so
sincerely but generally represent affected communities in a surrogate capacity [@Mansbridge2003]. Several groups representing local communities and led by community leaders have participated, but not nearly as often or with the same intensity as the
"big greens." The domination of large advocacy organizations highlights the importance of resources as a condition for lobbying and mobilizing. Not all groups that may benefit from generating political information can leverage it because they lack the resources to fund a campaign or even comment on relevant policies. However, smaller, more member-driven groups may partner with national groups that have more resources to mobilize on their behalf. Finally, a third, much less common type of commenter raises EJ issues to reframe them as ongoing debates and thus undermine their urgency. I call this reason for engaging an attempt to "break a perceived consensus." Though this strategy is intended to undermine EJ efforts, the fact that energy companies felt compelled to acknowledge and question EJ concerns suggests their importance for policy outcomes.

##### Commenter Race

To estimate the racial distribution of commenters
using EJ language, I select commenters who
signed with a
surname appearing in Census records. Figure
\@ref(fig:ejcommentsbyrace) shows a probabilistic racial
distribution of commenters who raise EJ concerns in
their comments based on the distribution of self-reported racial identities
associated with surnames as recorded in the 2010 census.^[I recode "Hispanic" as "Latinx."] I estimate this distribution using the proportion of people with a given surname identified as belonging to each racial
category (from this limited set of options). This approach does not
assign specific individuals to racial categories. Instead, it represents each commenter as a set of probabilities adding up to 1. The estimated racial distribution of the sample is the sum of individual probabilities.

```{r ejcommentsbyrace, fig.cap = 'Estimated Racial Distribution from Census Surnames of Commenters raising ``Environmental Justice" Concerns in Rulemaking', fig.height = 1.5, fig.width=2, out.width = "40%", fig.show = "hold"}
load(here::here("data", "ej_race.Rdata"))

Race %>% ggplot() + 
  aes(y =Race, x = Probability) + 
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())
```


Compared to the overall distribution in the 2010 census, this sample of commenters appears to be slightly disproportionately Black and less than proportionately
Latinx or Asian, with just slightly fewer Whites relative to the
national population. This is unsurprising, given that Black Americans have led theorizing and activism around environmental justice
[@Bullard1993].


### Tracing Ideas Through Rulemaking: Environmental Justice as a Contested Concept {#ej-methods}

Using an environmental justice frame does not always imply the same communities of concern. Environmental justice emerged from movements against environmental racism, especially the disposal of toxic materials in predominantly Black neighborhoods [@Bullard1993]. However, the term quickly took on other meanings, encompassing various marginalized groups. President Clinton's 1994 Executive Order on Environmental Justice required all parts of the federal government to make "addressing disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations" a core aspect of their mission. This meant considering the disproportionate effects of policies by race and income during rulemaking, thus broadening the scope beyond race.

In 2005, EPA political appointees reinterpreted the Order, removing race as a factor in identifying and prioritizing populations. This move was criticized by activists and two reports by EPA's own Office of Inspector General ([EPA-OIG-2004-P-00007](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-12/documents/20040301-2004-p-00007.pdf) and [EPA-OIG-2006-P-00034](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-11/documents/20060918-2006-p-00034.pdf)). 

President Obama's EPA Administrators reestablished race as a factor. They named EJ as one of their top priorities, but they also faced criticism from activists for paying lip service to environmental racism without adequate policy changes.

In an October 2017 proposed rule to repeal
restrictions on power plant pollution, the Trump EPA acknowledged that "low-income and minority communities located in proximity to [power plants] may have experienced an improvement in air quality as a result of the emissions reductions." This is remarkable given that "assertions that hazardous facilities are concentrated in minority and low-income communities in the United States and that those communities are exposed to inordinate amounts of environmental hazards" are "the most controversial claims of the environmental justice movement" (@Taylor2014, p. 1). Because the Obama EPA discussed EJ when promulgating the Clean Power Plan rule (stating that "climate change is an environmental justice issue"), the Trump EPA attempted to reframe rather than ignore environmental justice. The Trump EPA contended that the Obama EPA "did not address lower household energy bills for low-income households [and that] workers losing jobs in regions or occupations with weak labor markets would have been most vulnerable" (EPA 2017). Like regulated industry commenters, these statements frame the distribution of jobs and electricity costs as EJ issues in order to push back against policies that would equalize the distribution of health impacts from pollution. 

The central conflict over the role of race in policy analyses is just one of many conflicts that the environmental justice movement has caused to be fought somewhat on its terms. The next section briefly reviews the decades-long policy fight over regulating mercury pollution to illustrate how these definitional conflicts shape rules and rulemaking. This case and other examples in this article emerged from reading hundreds of rulemaking documents where agencies did and did not respond to comments raising EJ concerns. Their purpose is to assess whether the cases in the quantitative analysis are plausibly what they appear to be: that changes in rule text are, sometimes, causally related to public comments and that non-changes are cases of agencies disregarding comments, not some accident of the data or measures. 
The qualitative reading also confirmed other key assumptions, such as the fact that advocates do, in fact, use "environmental justice" when they raise distributional concerns, even on many rules that are not about issues traditionally considered "environmental."


#### The Evolving Distributive Politics of Mercury Pollution

Definitions of the public good and minority rights are
implicit in most policy documents, including agency rules. The public comment process offers an
opportunity to protest these definitions. Protest is one way that
marginalized groups can communicate opinions on issues to government
officials [@Gillion2013]. In the EPA's Mercury Rules, two
definitional issues were decisive. First, as with many forms of pollution,
mercury-emitting power plants are concentrated in low-income and
non-White communities. Second, some populations consume much more
locally-caught freshwater fish, a major vector of mercury toxicity.
Studies inspired by the political controversy around the Mercury Rules
found high risk among certain communities, including "Hispanic, Vietnamese, and
Laotian populations in California and Great Lakes tribal populations
(Chippewa and Ojibwe) active on ceded territories around the Great
Lakes" (EPA 2012). Thus the standards that EPA chooses depend on whom the regulation aims to protect: the average citizen,
local residents, or fishing communities. Mercury regulations have disparate
effects based on race and class because of disparate effects based on
geography and cultural practices. 

In December 2000, when the EPA first announced its intention to regulate
mercury from power plants, the notice published in the *Federal Register*
did not address EJ issues, such as the disparate
effects of mercury on certain populations; it only discussed anticipated impacts in
reference to "the U.S. population" (EPA 2000). When the first draft rule
was published, it only discussed the effects of the rule on regulated
entities, noting that "Other types of entities not listed could also be
affected" (EPA 2002). 
Commenting on this draft, Heather McCausland of
the Alaska Community Action on Toxics (ACAT) wrote:

> The amount of methyl-mercury and other bioaccumulative chemicals consumed by Alaskans (especially Alaskan Natives) could potentially be much higher than is assumed... [This could increase] the Alaskan Native mortality rate for babies, which according to the CDC, is 70% higher than the United States average. Indigenous Arctic & Alaskan Native populations are some of the most polluted populations in the world. Global transport & old military sites contaminate us too. <!--([EPA-HQ-OAR-2012-0452-0006](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2012-0452-0006))-->

By citing the CDC, McCausland's comment provided both technical and distributive information. As allies mobilized, public pressure mounted to address the disparate impacts of mercury levels.
After receiving hundreds of thousands of comments and pressure from
tribal governments and organizations, a revised proposed rule echoed McCausland's
comment noting that 

> Some subpopulations in the U.S., such as Native
Americans, Southeast Asian Americans, and lower-income subsistence
fishers may rely on fish as a primary source of nutrition and/or for
cultural practices. Therefore, they consume larger amounts of fish than
the general population and may be at a greater risk of the adverse
health effects from Hg due to increased exposure ([04-1539/p-719](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/04-1539/p-719)).

After nearly a million additional public comments, a further revised proposed
rule ultimately included five pages of analysis of the disparate impacts
on "vulnerable populations" including "African Americans," "Hispanic,"
"Native American," and "Other and Multi-racial" groups (EPA 2011). In the final rule, "vulnerable populations" was replaced
with "minority, low income, and indigenous populations" (EPA 2012). The EPA
had also conducted an analysis of sub-populations with particularly high
potential risks of exposure due to high rates of fish consumption as well
as additional analysis of the distribution of mortality risk by
race.

Of this second round of comments, over 200 unique comments explicitly raised
EJ issues. The Little River Band of Ottawa Indians
expressed the Tribe's 

> ...frustration at trying to impress upon the EPA the multiple and profound impacts of mercury contamination from a Tribal perspective. Not to mention the obligations under treaties to participate with tribes on a 'Government to Government' basis. At present, no such meetings have occurred in any meaningful manner with EPA Region V, the EPA National American Indian Environmental Office, nor the State of Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality... In this rulemaking, the EPA perpetuated, rather than ameliorated, a long history of cultural discrimination against tribes and their members ([EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0234-12462](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0234-12462), p. 67). <!-- (Sprague
2011). -->

<!-- See Dwidar --> 

Did comments like these play a role in EPA's changed analysis of whom mercury limits should aim to protect? Because of the many potential sources of influence, it may be difficult to attribute causal effects of particular comments on a given policy.
However, comments may serve as a good proxy for the general mobilization
of groups and individuals around an administrative process, and it is
not clear why else the EPA would not address EJ in the first
draft of a rule and then add it to subsequent drafts in the absence of
activist pressure. Electoral politics does not offer an easy
explanation. The notice proposing the Mercury Rule was issued by the
Clinton administration, the same administration that issued the
Executive Order on Environmental Justice, and the subsequent drafts that
did address EJ issues were published by the Bush
administration, which had a more contentious relationship with
EJ advocates, while Republicans controlled both
houses of Congress. The expansion of the analysis from one draft to the
next seems to be in response to activist pressure.


### Measuring Policy Change

Examples in the previous section illustrate how text mentioning "environmental justice" might be added or changed. ^[Carefully tracing a few rulemaking processes also helped to avoid analytic pitfalls. For example, one case where an agency did an EJ analysis and then appeared not to respond to a comment discussing EJ was, in fact, due to the fact that the commenter included an annotated version of the draft rule in their comment, adding only "no comment" next to the 12898 section. To correct this, I removed text copied from the proposed rule from comments in pre-processing.]
Having shown how public comments and pressure can influence policy texts, this section assesses the general relationship between comments and policy texts across all rules. I use two indicators of responsiveness to model the effect of public comments on policy documents: *whether* a policy addresses EJ and change in *how* it addresses EJ, i.e., change in portions of the text discussing EJ. Both measures represent a relatively low bar, indicating whether the agency explicitly paid any attention to EJ. This is similar to measures of "procedural responsiveness" used by @Balla2020. The low empirical bar is appropriate because prior research, including the results reviewed in Chapter \@ref(influence), shows little to no effect of public comments from advocacy groups [@Yackee2006JOP; @Balla2020] and low levels of attention to EJ concerns in particular [@Gauna2001, @Revez2018]. Recall from Figure \@ref(fig:ej-data) that only 10% of rules even mention environmental justice. <!--[@Hughes2020].-->



#### Measure 1: Adding Text Addressing EJ to Final Rules

For the subset of draft rules that did not address EJ, I measure whether agencies added any mention of "environmental justice" in the final rule. Such additions usually take the form of an "E.O. 12898" section where the agency justifies its policy changes with respect to some concept(s) of EJ. The next most common addition occurs in the agency's response to comments, explaining how the rule did not have disparate effects or that they were insignificant.

Agencies may both respond to a comment and add a 12898 section. For example, the EPA responded to several commenters, including Earthjustice, the Central Valley Air Quality Coalition, the Coalition for Clean Air, Central California Environmental Justice Network, and Central California Asthma Collaborative: "EPA agrees it is important to consider environmental justice in our actions and we briefly addressed environmental justice principles in our proposal." As the commenters noted, the EPA had not, in fact, addressed EJ in the proposed rule, which approved California rules regulating particulate matter emissions from construction sites, unpaved roads, and disturbed soils in open and agricultural areas. EPA did add a fairly generic 12898 section to the final rule but did not substantively change the rest of the policy. 

Less frequently, an agency may explicitly dismiss a comment and decline to add a 12898 section. For example, the G.W. Bush EPA responded to a comment on another rule, "One commenter stated that EPA failed to comply with Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice...We do not believe that these amendments will have any adverse effects on...minority and low-income populations...Owners or operators are still required to develop SSM plans to address emissions...The only difference from current regulations is that the source is not required to follow the plan" (71 FR 20445). As these examples illustrate, agencies may add text addressing EJ that would not satisfy critics. This measure merely indicates whether the agency engaged with the claims.

<!--Barry: you say that change between draft and final rules is the evidence that the agency "engaged" with EJ comments. But I don't think that's quite right. The agency might have engaged heavily but decided that the draft rule was fine. It's really whether the comments persuaded them that a change was necessary.-->

Most frequently, agencies neither responded to comments nor added a 12898 section.

#### Measure 2: Changing Text Addressing EJ in Final Rules

Where draft rules did address EJ, I assessed whether a rule changed *how* it discussed "environmental justice" between its draft and final publication.^[Occasionally, there is more than one version of a proposed or final rule on a rulemaking docket. Here I opt for an inclusive measure of change that counts change from *any* proposed to *any* final rule. If the change occurred between the first and second draft of a proposed rule, I count it as a change. This best captures the concept of rule change. However, estimates are similar if we only count cases where a change occurred between *every* version of the rule.] 
When an agency addresses EJ in the draft rule, it is almost always in a section about how it addressed E.O. 12898. In many cases, much of the text of final rules, including 12898 sections, remain exactly the same between draft and final versions. 
To measure change, I parse draft and final rules into sentences and identify sentences containing the phrase "environmental justice." If an agency leaves these sentences unchanged between the draft and final rule and adds no new sentences mentioning EJ, this suggests that the agency did not engage with comments raising EJ concerns.^[An alternative approach would be to parse documents by section and assess whether E.O.12898 sections are identical. Parsing by sentences has three advantages: it is computationally faster, it avoids problems with section numbering and other frustrations with section matching, and it captures attention to EJ outside of this section, especially in the section responding to comments. If an agency is paying attention to EJ issues, sentence matching will likely detect it. 

```{asis, echo = book}
However, other measures, such as the percent of EJ sentences changed, the percent of words in a 12898 section that changed, or the change in topic proportions [@Judge-Lord2017], could be useful in future work.
