% CONCLUSION
%This research will add to our understanding of how  bureaucratic policymaking fits with the practice of democracy.
If input solicited from ordinary people has little effect on policy outcomes, directly or indirectly, it may be best understood as providing a veneer of democratic legitimacy on an essentially technocratic and/or elite-driven process.
The legitimacy of bureaucratic policymaking is said to depend on the premise that rulemaking provides an outlet for public voice \citep{Croley2003, Rosenbloom2003}. Yet, it is not just the opportunity to engage, but actual engagement that matters \citep{Herz2018}, and we lack an empirical base necessary to evaluate whether any legitimacy the public comment process may provide is deserved, even if people believe that their comments matter \citep{Yackee2014JPART}.
If mass engagement does shape agency decisions, a new research program will be needed to investigate who exactly these campaigns mobilize and represent.
