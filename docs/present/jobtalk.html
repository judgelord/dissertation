&gt; # "He who determines what politics is about runs the country because the definition of alternatives is the choice of conflicts, and the choice of conflicts allocates power. " - E.E. Schattschneider



???
The broader project is part of a recent movement to bring back some of EE SchttschNeider's insights about politics as organized conflict over policy. 

Antagonists rarely agree on what the issues are because power is involved in the definition...

This paper especially builds on the insight that 
The ability to affect what politics is about---the terms of the debate---can have major impacts on political outcomes. 

But to ground my larger quantitative analysis, I want to start with an example of regulations on Mercury pollution.

#If groups successfully push Congress to pass the Green New Deal, what happens when 30+ agencies write the actual policies? 

???
What happens when dozens of agencies then write the implementing rules?

And Congress keeps making me change this slide.

#If groups successfully push Congress to pass the ~~Green New Deal~~   
#~~Build Back Better Act~~
# Inflation Reduction Act, what happens when 33 agencies write the actual policies? 

???
AND NOW THAT climate groups HAVE pushed through landmark climate policy in the Inflation Reduction Act THAT DOES, in fact, by my count, task at least 33 agencies with writing rules about how exactly this massive amount of money will be spent AND new regulations requiring companies to use the technologies funded by the act.

For example, consider that the Biden Administration has pledged to spend 40% of climate and energy spending, including billions of dollars from IRA and bipartisan infrastructure bills in disadvantaged and EJ communities. Those funding criteria that determine who is eligible are being developed through agency rulemaking.

# Does public pressure affect bureaucratic policymaking?



&lt;!--
If so, by what mechanisms?

- General level of public attention?

- Specific pressure to address issues like environmental justice?

- By targeting more receptive institutions?
--&gt;

???
Will organized public pressure carry over to agency policymaking? 

- If so, what kinds of politics are influential? Is it general attention? Is it specific pressure groups like environmental justice activists?

- are some institutions more receptive to pressure on EJ than others? 

Puzzle: Does public pressure work on specific policies?

Even those made y bureaucrats? 

???
Bureaucratic policymaking, especially, is about expertise. 

???

All our theories tell us that this probably does not occur, and if it does occur, it should not matter. 

Everything we know about lobbying, especially lobbying in agency rulemaking, tells us that information is the currency of lobbying. 

Information causes policymakers to change their minds, *especially* when policymakers are experts and lawyers.

Indeed, research, including my own research elsewhere, shows that business groups dominate lobbying in rulemaking *because* they can generate and provide relevant information.

## Preview

So now that I have persuaded you that studying the politics of bureaucratic policymaking is massively important and interesting, I'm putting a roadmap for the rest of the talk on the top of my slides. I'll talk a bit about what we know and what existing theory tells us to expect. 
Then I'll review the novel data and methods I am bringing to this question
Then I'll show some of the results and conclude with implications for theory, including implications from the broader project. 

--

&lt;!--
- [Motivation:](#motivation) 90% of U.S. policy is made by agencies  
---&gt;

- [Theory:](#theory) Public pressure informs bureaucrats
--

- [Data:](#data) Change in 13,000 draft and final rule pairs
--
`\(\Longleftarrow\)` 40 million public comments
--

- [Methods:](#methods) Hand-coding `\(\Longleftrightarrow\)` computational text analysis


???
13k policy pairs, for example, the draft and final version of the mercury rule

I used a combination of quantitative and qualitative text analysis to analyze 40 million public comments. Nearly all public comments received on thousands of draft policies by 40 agencies that make policies related to environmental justice. The larger project looks at 161 agencies, but here I focus on agencies that make environmental policy---or, more precisely, agencies that make policy that is occasionally framed as environmental policy.

--

- [Findings](#findings)   
 - Policy rarely addresses environmental justice
???

There is a lot of potential for change, which is a tough road for the movement, but helpful for the scientist trying to measure change.
--

 - When groups raise concerns, policy texts change 

???

And when I say policy texts, I mean agency rules.

--
 - `\(\uparrow\)` pressure  `\(\rightsquigarrow\)` 	`\(\uparrow\)` change 

???

Today, I'm going to show that public pressure can affect the policy process. 
WHEN groups raise concerns, policy texts change to reflect them. 
And when more groups and people are mobilized, the probability that policymakers respond increases.

???

It matters whether policymakers adopt these issue frames because redefining problems can change policymakers' calculations, both political and economic. For example, if you make a policy about climate change, a whole avalanche of new costs and benefits enter the equation. 
If activists can get policymakers thinking about DISTRIBUTIE justice---how costs and benefits of policies are unequally distributed---this can change the math as well.
Issue frames affect the cost-benefit analysis.

But there are several important caveats. And the caveats are often the most interesting part. 

The first caveat is that pressure matters more to more receptive policymakers.
--
 - Responsiveness varies with institutional structure  

???
-policymakers who are used to thinking about ej at institutions with organizational processes for addressing EJ. 

The second caveat is that these results are driven by historically-White national advocacy organizations, not tribes or local “frontline” local groups in those "environmental justice communities” that the Biden administration is referencing with the justice 40 initiative.

??? 


--
 - Policymakers are more responsive to national advocacy organizations 

???

It matters who is raising concerns.

## U.S. federal agencies rarely address environmental justice but are more likely to when pressured.

???

In a sentence, policymakers, that is, people making policy at U.S. federal agencies, rarely address environmental justice but are more likely to when pressured.

And furthermore, I'll show that it is receptive policymakers who have not already taken a position.


???

Finally, assessing the normative implications requires us to understand who is advocating for whom. In the case of comments on federal agency rules, it is “big green” national advocacy groups that have historically led a White environmental movement. 
These ”big greens” are more likely to get substantive policy demands met than Tribes and frontline community groups. So, a lot hinges on the extent to which these national organizations represent EJ communities.

If you or your partner has been pregnant, you know that you need to be really careful about fish because mercury pollution accumulates in fish and is really harmful to brain development in fetuses and young kids. 

Coal-fired power plants are the largest source of mercury; they emit 72% of all mercury pollution in the United States. Every state in the country has issued a fish advisory of some type because of unsafe mercury contamination.

So, how did policymakers respond to mercury pollution?

EPA had to then merely had to fill in little details like questions like who is the public and, what is health, what is appropriate and necessary? 


AND the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) Clinton and GW Bush administrations 
produced Mercury regulations under the authority of the clean air act.

When an agency does this, it must go through a process called rulemaking.

10,000+ comments

For example, the Alaska Community Action on Toxic wrote
`“The amount of methyl-mercury and other bioaccumulative chemicals consumed by Alaskans (especially Alaskan Natives) could potentially be much higher than is assumed” - Heather McCausland of the Alaska Community Action on Toxics (ACAT).`

Advocates like Heather argued that mercury standards that protected the average person in the US did not protect certain minority communites, in this case, many native communities who traditionally ate a lot more fish. 

I grew up in Wisconsin, in the center of the great lakes, and despite Friday fish fries, these regulations probably protected people in my family, BUT 

And there is a large Hmong population that came over after the Vietnam war, and other commenters raised produced studies that certain southeast Asian immigrant populations like the Hmong also ate a lot of freshwater fish and thus had higher rates of Mercury poisoning. Similarly,  Ojibwe people in the great lakes region had higher rates of mercury poising. 

So, after all of this pressure, the Bush EPA made changes. [SLIDE]

The Final Rule included a new section on the unequal impacts of mercury pollution. Even half of the cost-benefit analysis now talked about how the costs of mercury pollution were unequally distributed. This goal of environmental justice was the justification for imposing social costs of power plant regulation. 

And when the Obama EPA returned to the topic of mercury pollution, they received half a million comments, many raising environmental justice concerns.

# The Environmental Justice Frame

???

What is environmental justice, and why does the Biden administration require 40% of federal spending to be spent in environmental justice communities? 

The EJ movement began in local resistance to toxic waste in places like the  Alt-geld Gardens housing complex on Chicago's South Side, where activists like Hazel Johnson had been organizing tenants years before a young Barak Obama showed up in 1984. Surrounded by manufacturing and toxic waste dumps, this neighborhood got the nickname “the toxic doughnut.” 

Dorceta Taylor describes how black-led campaigns like Johnson's fused with the American Indian Movement, Chicano, and farmworker movements and drew on civil rights and union organizing to push the environmental justice frame onto the national policy agenda. 

Began appearing in federal policy documents in the 1980s

My aim is to add some more systematic quantitative data on the broad trends regarding the influence of the EJ movement on the federal policy agenda that Taylor and others have mapped.

1. Distinct phrase (few false positives) without many synonyms (few false negatives)

1. E.O. 12898 "Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice" (1993)


--

Why this matters:


- "Environmental" policy is
 - inconsistently racialized
 - inconsistently focused on *distributions* of costs and benefits

--

- Reframing policy in distributive justice terms can shape normative, political, and even economic analysis.

## Do Movements Cause Policy Change?

There is more about what social movement shot. 

The big question is whether social movements impact policy.

- And as Theda Skocpol found in her study of why climate legislation failed, a movement is often a necessary condition for policy change

- **Redistributive policies often require  movements** (Lowi &amp; Nicholson 2015)

### Scholars of bureaucracy focus on *technical* information

- Bureaucratic policymaking, especially, is about expertise (Wagner 2010)


Everything we know about lobbying, especially lobbying in agency rulemaking, tells us that information is the currency of lobbying. 

Information causes policymakers to change their minds, *especially* when policymakers are experts and lawyers.

Indeed, research, including my own research elsewhere, shows that business groups dominate lobbying in rulemaking *because* they can generate and provide relevant information. 

Thus far, by “information,” scholars generally mean technical and legal information.

### Does *political* information matter?

- Frames about who is affected? [(Jones &amp; Baumgartner 1991, Lowi 1972, Schneider &amp; Ingram 1993, Woodly 2015)]()

- Coalition size? [(Dwidar 2021, Nelson &amp; Yackee 2012)]()

- Public attention? [(Schattschneider 1972 vs. Balla et al. 2020)]()

???

But none of these papers have XXXX

I am going to test these in a large-scale way.

Lowi TODO 

Coalition size = NUMBER OF GROUPS 

(Balla et al. 2020 find that “legal imperatives trump political considerations”)

(Jones and Baumgartner 2009)

I ask about the role of a different kind of information---what we might call POLITICAL information, building on Nelson and Yackee's finding that coalition size matters.

We might also wonder if groups raising distributive claims would matter (Lowi would say distributions of costs and benefits should matter) 

I'm also curious whether public pressure or public attention matter. Here scholarship is skeptical. Balla et al. concluded that mass comment campaigns don't matter because “legal imperatives trump political considerations.” in responding to comments. That technocratic rationality dominates, meaning that political information is not affecting the policy process. I want to test this claim.

### Research tends to explain social movement emergence rather than specific impacts (McAdam 2017) 

- **“limited research on [social movement] influence”** (Andrews &amp; Edwards 2004)
- **The DV is rarely specific policy outcomes or systematic impact**


???
In the paper, I note some of the great work in political science studying the impact of movements on policy change, but much of the systematic work focuses on explaining mobilization. Movement activity and structure are the typical DVs. 

&lt;!--### My DV: Change in specific policies (agency rules)--&gt; 

???
I am trying to add to recent work on the policy impact of movements and pressure campaigns by looking systematically at change in very specific policy documents.

Whether executive branch agencies are implementing recent legislation or using the authority of century-old statutes,  Rulemaking is where the teeth of federal law are forged and reforged over time.

So, I'm interested in the extent to which movements can affect agency rulemaking.

???

The aggregate impact of environmental justice campaigns across institutions and over time `\(\rightsquigarrow\)` environmental justice movement impact

And I'm thinking about social movement impact as the aggregate impact of EJ campaigns across institutions and over time.

If you remember, one thing about the methods here is that Human coding and computational text analysis are more powerful when combined, and I have several ways of doing that. 

First, I use something like plagiarism detection to identify linked sets of documents that indicate that groups of commenters are in a lobbying coalition.

Elsewhere, I used these same methods to assess the change between the draft and final rule, and there are tutorials for how to do this on my website. 

Here is what this looks like on a larger set of comments

Using n-gram matching methods similar to plagiarism detection, I collapse form letters and petitions into representative texts. As most comments are form letters, that 5 million collapses to 28 thousand unique texts.
This figure shows the percentage of shared text in a sample of documents.
The black squares on the diagonal show that each comment has a perfect overlap with itself. 
The block of grey partial matches reflects a public pressure campaign, with a lot of shared 10-grams. 
I then attach these to lobbying coalitions by hand.

# Model Results 



--

## (1) Variation across agencies:  
Pr(Policy Change | President) ~ Policy Demands  \+ Coalition Size  \+ Public Attention \+ Policymaker (Agency) Receptivity

--

## (2) Variation within agencies:  
Pr(Policy Change | President + Agency) ~ Policy Demands  \+  Coalition Size  \+  Public Attention

???
Both of my DVs---adding EJ language and changing existing EJ language--are dichotomous, so I m going to use logit regression. 

The main models use president and agency fixed effects, so I'm focusing on variation within presidential administrations and within the agency, but I also assess differences across presidents and agencies by estimating the same models with indicators rather than fixed effects.

Because log odds coefficients are hard to interpret and because my models have interactions, I am going to skip the regression table and just show you predicted probabilities. 



???

Because I expect decreasing marginal effects of additional comments, both overall (i.e., public attention) and those that mention EJ (coalition size), I use logged values. 

However, the conclusions are largely the same if I use a quadradic function instead. That analysis suggests that medium levels of attention are not so impactful. A small level of attention matters, and then it takes a very large amount of additional pressure to move things, which makes sense. For hypothesis testing, however, all of the effects are in the same direction, so I am going to present predicted probabilities from these models here.

All of the plots I'll show have predicted probability of change on the x-axis and some predictors we care about on the y-axis. This one also shows predicted values for two different agencies, the EPA and the PHMSA.

???

Finally, assessing the normative implications requires us to understand who is advocating for whom. In the case of comments on federal agency rules, it is “big green" national advocacy groups that have historically led a White environmental movement. 
These "big greens" are more likely to get substantive policy demands met than Tribes and frontline community groups. So, a lot hinges on the extent to which these national organizations represent EJ communities.

Human coding and computational text analysis are more powerful when combined in an iterative workflow.
&lt;!--I show how search and text-reuse tools can aid common hand-coding tasks. 
Human coding can both inform and be informed by rule-based information extraction---iteratively structuring queries on unstructured text.--&gt;

1. Text analysis tools can strategically **select texts for human coders**---texts representing larger samples and outlier texts of high inferential value.
2. Preprocessing can **speed up hand-coding** by extracting features like names and key sentences. 
3. Humans and computers can iteratively **tag entities** using regex tables 
&lt;!--(e.g., identify organizations)--&gt; and **group texts by key features** (e.g., identify lobbying coalitions by common policy demands)

---

Applying simple search and text-reuse methods to public comments on all U.S. federal agency rules, a **sample of 10,894 hand-coded comments** yields **41 million as-good-as-hand-coded comments** regarding both the organizations that mobilized them and the extent to which policy changed in the direction they sought. &lt;!--This large sample enables new analyses of lobbying coalitions, social movements, and policy change.--&gt;

Workflow: `googlesheets4` allows analysis and improving data in real-time. For example, in Fig. 1: 

- The "org_name" column is populated with a guess from automated methods. As humans identify new organizations and aliases, other documents with the same entity strings are auto-coded to match human coding.   
- As humans identify each organization's policy "ask," other texts with the same ask are put in their coalition.   
- If the organization and coalition become known, it no longer needs hand coding.

The textrank algorithm creates a bipartite network of sentence pairs that share words and then applies Google Pagerank on the sentence network to rank sentences [@textrank]. This is the summary method I use, in part because many federal agencies used the textrank algorithm to summarize public comments. This means that the sentences chosen by textrank may be especially likely to be seen and quoted by agency officials responding to comments.  

Topic models also provide helpful summary information. Frequent and exclusive words associated with the topic(s) occurring in the highest proportions in the document may be helpful summary information. 

Similarly, the results of supervised machine classification can also simplify human coding [@Sebok2021]. For example, @Chou2019 use k-means clustering to classify sentences in audit reports and select sentences close to cluster centroids as summaries for human auditors. Humans with basic domain knowledge are well-suited to check and correct the results of machine coding. Human coders might dig deeper into cases where the machine coding looks off (given other available metadata, like associated entities, summaries, or topics). As humans do such a task, they likely learn how the classifier(s) tend to error. Future human and computational attention can then be paid to those cases. 


Nothing is language-dependent. Whereas statistical models of word frequencies require language-dependent preprocessing for dimension reduction [@Lucas2015], regex tables and text reuse are not.


# Classification 
"The tasks of estimating category percentages (quantification) or classifying individual documents (classification) both begin by analyzing a small subset of documents with (usually hand-coded) category labels." [@Jerzak2019]

The brand of linguistics that focuses on the combinations of words we use emphasises the recurring nature of phrases. 
"utterances are formed by repetition, modification, and concatenation of previously-known phrases consisting of more than one word...we speak mostly by stitching together swatches of text that we have heard before."
[@Becker1975]

Numerical representation of text documents can have an outsized impact on the results (see Denny and Spirling, 2016; Levy, Goldberg, and Dagan, 2015). 

A corpus may lack textual discrimination regarding word frequencies [@Jerzak2019], but still be classified by phrases long enough that they are highly unlikely to appear by chance. 

Another advangage of key phrases is that it cleanly allows texts to appear in multiple groups.

# Public participation

The first is about the nature of public participation. And I'm focusing here no participation beyond elections, but participation in particular policy debates. 

When we think about voice in government decision, the image that comes to mind might be something like this Norman Rockwell painting

Here a man stands up and voices his opinion at a public meeting. From is dress, we are told that he is working class, not elite, and yet he is heard. 

But a fundamental observation from the literature on public participation, going back to Verba and Nie and the vast literature on social movements, is that most people particpate when they are mobilized by public pressure campaigns run by organized groups.

To be acurate today. Rockwell would need to paint this man and his allies in matching t-shirts reading from the script provided by the mobilizing organization.

Clicking on "Take action" button it takes you to a website where you can submit a comment on the draft regulations.

And here the Sierra Club is using the same graphic to mobilize people to write to the Trump administration asking it not to reverse the Obama-era regulations. 


And the internet makes it much easier to mobilize large numbers of people to engage in specific policy processes. You can on proposed policies from your phone.

???

And this is really the modal way that people engage with policymakers---submitting a letter drafted by a large national advocacy group.

There is a long tradition of letter writing and petitioning policymakers in the US,

AND NOW, With the internet, social media, and campaign technologies, pressure campaigns are mobilizing millions more people to engage in particular policy fights than ever before. 

But our institutions for incorporating public input on proposed policies are not built for this digital massi mobilizing. At the end, I'll return to what my research says about how we can make government more responsive in the age of digtial campaigns. 



NOW,  THE FACT that the sierra club is targeting the Environmental Protection Agency, leads me to the second observation about modern American Politics, which comes from a completely different literature.

When we think of where law is made, we think of Congress. 
HOWEVER, scholars of the policy process know that MOST US POLICY IS MADE IN THE BUREAUCRACY.

???

This is especially true in some policy areas like  environmental policy, where nearly all of the policy action has been in the agencies for my entire life---regulating under one administration, deregulating under the next---and courts reviewing agency policies. 

The process by which agencies make policy is different than Congress.
Agency rulemaking---rulemaking is the process by which agencies make binding law---is where most policy fights now take place.

# Mobilized public pressure 
# in bureaucracy policymaking


???

Putting these two observations together, I argue that to understand our democracy, we must understand the role of public pressure in bureaucratic policymaking. 

And, importantly, this is true EVEN WHEN CONGRESS DOES LEGISLATE.

For years, I have been working on this, thinking about this question, if Congress Passes landmark legislation like the GND,

## Data: Comments on Draft Rules

Of 13,111 relevant agency rules, less than 15% addressed environmental justice, and 8%  addressed climate change, despite growing activist demand.

Of 39,392,957 public comments 

- 20% &lt;!--, 17,857,018 (421,880 unique)--&gt; raise "climate change"

- 2% &lt;!--, 3,248,697 (2,138 unique)--&gt; also mention environmental justice or climate justice

- 82% of all comments raising EJ also mention climate change, but only 14% of **unique** comments raising EJ also mention climate change

## Why EJ?

1. Variation in issue framing: "environmental" policy is inconsistently racialized +  inconsistently focused on *distributions* of costs and benefits

1. Distinct phrase (few false positives) without many synonyms (few false negatives)

1. E.O. 12898 "Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice" (1993)


???

--&gt; Administrative Procedures Act lawsuits: 
&gt; "environmental justice analysis can be reviewed under NEPA and the APA" (*Protect Our Communities Foundation v. Salazar* 2013; *Communities Against Runway Expansion, Inc. v. FAA* 2004)


Environmental Justice For All Act (2020) introduced by Senator Harris

The day after Biden's executive order was launched, Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO) and Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced the Environmental Justice Mapping and Data Collection Act of 2021, which builds on many of the concepts in the executive order and would create a whole-of-government initiative, including data infrastructure and funding to “identify communities most at risk from environmental injustices.”

---

When I state my hypotheses, I put them in the direction that EJ campaigns do affect policy, while noting equally powerful intuitions going the other direction. 
I really think there are good intuitions going both ways. 
These are very much two-tailed tests. 

---

### *Distributive Claims Hypothesis*: 

&gt; Policymakers are more likely to address distributive justice when groups raise distributive justice concerns.

 `\(\color{\green}{\checkmark}\)` Pro: "norms and values are set communicatively" (Habermas 1996), "identifying interests" shapes policy (Gellhorn 1972)   

`\(\Large\color{\red}{\unicode{10007}}\)` Con: Bureaucratic policymaking is about "technical expertise" (Epstein et al. 2014)

???
First, we might expect policymakers are more likely to address distributive justice when groups raise distributive justice concerns.

Conversely, if bureaucratic policymaking is about "technical expertise"

---

### *Coalition Size Hypothesis*

&gt; Policymakers are more likely to address concerns as more groups raise them.

✅ :
Coalition size (Nelson and Yackee  2012) &amp; pressure (Gillion 2013; Wasow 2020)

❌ : "Informational value" (Epstein et al. 2014; Gailmard &amp; Patty 2017; Libgober 2018)

???

On the one hand we might expect policymakers to respond to the scale of pressure to address EJ.

On the other hand, all of the formal models to date are focused on providing new information. 
I really like Brian Libgober's model of how comments inform rulemaking, but it relies on telling policymakers something they didn't already know. 

---

### *Policy Receptivity Hypothesis*

&gt; Policymakers that more frequently address certain concerns will be more responsive to groups raising those concerns.

&lt;!-- "Legibility" (Scott 1998), --&gt;
✅ : "Opportunity structure" (Marks &amp; McAdam 2007; McAdam 2010) "fit inside the legal narrative" (Scott 1998; Deloria 2009; Hilson 2002; Delaney 2017)   

❌ : "New information" Farina (2018)

???
Regarding policy receptivity
Political opportunity may not just be about access to policymakers but also in terms of political receptivity to the claims being made." (Hilson 2002, p. 242)

Claims may be more impactful when they are more legible to policymakers and fit inside their existing legal narrative and self-concept of what their job is.

Other legal scholars and formal models suggest that information should matter most when it is not something policymaker is already thinking about. If they are right, then we should expect the opposite---that activists raising EJ concerns are most influential at agencies that DON'T usually think about EJ---where it presents them with something new.

---

### *Public Attention Hypothesis*

&gt; Policies are more likely to change when they receive more public attention (e.g., more public comments).

✅ : Leech (2010)

❌ : Lowery (2013), Balla et al. (2020)

???

Finally, there is this debate over whether high or low salience policies are more liklely to change. 

We might expect that policies are more likely to change when there is more overall public attention, regardless of pressure to address EJ in particular. 

On the other hand, if it is easier to lobby out of the public spotlight, we might expect low-salience policies to be more likely to change. 

Balla et al's study of responses to comments in rulemaking suggests a no effect. Legal scholars tend to see the scale of public attention is just not a legal concern. 

And again, formal models don't really have a parameter for public attention or pressure.
