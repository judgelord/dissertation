Hi, my name is Devin Judge-Lord; I'm a postdoc at Harvard Univ.
I am so grateful to be able to share this with you.
- My work is at the intersection of two literatures that have not had much contact...On the one hand, social movements and civic engagement have long been a core interest of political scientists. We are highly uncertain about the size of the effects of actions like letter writing, signing petitions, and protests, but there is little doubt that these things matter at a large enough scale.
- On the other hand, bureaucratic policy processes like agency rulemaking are often discussed as if they operate with technocratic rationality. In a sense, mass politics is missing from a lot of the administrative law literature and even from political science theories and formal models of bureaucratic policymaking. 
- The paper I am presenting today is a small part of a larger book project:

Surviving judicial review


???

It is a middle step in the causal chain from mobilization to substantive policy influence. 
As I turn this chapter into an article,
I am struggling to include just enough and not too much of what comes before and after.

I need enough about mobilization to be clear about who is empowered.

I need enough substantive policy influence, to be honest about the limited power of framing and discourse effects in any one policy fight. 
But, this paper is really about the aggregate effects of many linked campaigns on the discourse and issue frames in the policy process---that is, how a movement affects policymaking 
across institutions and over time.

### Scholars of bureaucracy focus on *technical* information


???
- Bureaucratic policymaking, especially, is about expertise (Wagner 2010)


Everything we know about lobbying, especially lobbying in agency rulemaking, tells us that information is the currency of lobbying. 

Information causes policymakers to change their minds, *especially* when policymakers are experts and lawyers.

Indeed, research, including my own research elsewhere, shows that business groups dominate lobbying in rulemaking *because* they can generate and provide relevant information. 

Thus far, by “information,” scholars generally mean technical and legal information.

### How might *political* information matter?

--

- Advancing frames about who is affected?

--

- Legibility vs. novelty?

- Pressure: 

 - Coalition size? [(Dwidar 2021, Nelson & Yackee 2012)]()

 - Public attention?

# Data

### *All* 13,179 draft and final rule pairs from 40 agencies, 1993-2020 

### ~40,000,000 public comments on these draft rules



???

We don't have roll call votes. 

I collected all 40 million comments on these draft and final rule pairs. 
Almost 5 million mentioned EJ.

28 thousand of these are unique --- This involved some methodological tricks that I will explain in a second, but the major point is that Human coding and computational text analysis are more powerful when combined

Carving out a paper: More or less on mobilization or hand-coded influence? 

Is the aggregate influence of related campaigns a defensible working deff of a social movement, or is there a better way of talking about this? 

co-framing (Baumgartner and Jones) 

Next Steps
- More on coalition structure and policy success, especially opposing coalitions
- Better (hand-coded) measures of policy change
- Model changes in texts that already discuss climate/EJ/CJ

Framing 
- More on how social movements may impact policy. Petitioning and protest? Lobbying?

# Methods 




---

Human coding and computational text analysis are more powerful when combined in an iterative workflow.
<!--I show how search and text-reuse tools can aid common hand-coding tasks. 
Human coding can both inform and be informed by rule-based information extraction---iteratively structuring queries on unstructured text.-->

1. Text analysis tools can strategically **select texts for human coders**---texts representing larger samples and outlier texts of high inferential value.
2. Preprocessing can **speed up hand-coding** by extracting features like names and key sentences. 
3. Humans and computers can iteratively **tag entities** using regex tables 
<!--(e.g., identify organizations)--> and **group texts by key features** (e.g., identify lobbying coalitions by common policy demands)

---

Applying simple search and text-reuse methods to public comments on all U.S. federal agency rules, a **sample of 10,894 hand-coded comments** yields **41 million as-good-as-hand-coded comments** regarding both the organizations that mobilized them and the extent to which policy changed in the direction they sought. <!--This large sample enables new analyses of lobbying coalitions, social movements, and policy change.-->

### Hand-coding dynamic data

<!--

- 15 coders 

```{r greyhound, fig.cap= "Incorrectly Labeled Coalition Identified by Automated Check"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("figs", "greyhound.png"))
```

--->

Workflow: `googlesheets4` allows analysis and improving data in real time. For example: 

- The "org_name" column is populated with a guess from automated methods. As humans identify new organizations and aliases, other documents with the same entity strings are auto-coded to match human coding.   
- As humans identify each organization's policy "ask," other texts with the same ask are put in their coalition.   
- If the organization and coalition become known, it no longer needs hand coding.

# Grouping with key phrases

1. Humans identify groups of selected documents (e.g., lobbying coalitions)
2. Humans copy and paste key phrases
3. Computer puts other documents containing those phrases in the same group (coalition)

*Preprocessing tip:* 
<!--**Digitized text** allows humans to paste text exactly matching machine-read strings.  -->
**Summaries** speed hand-coding (e.g., use `textrank` to select representative sentences).

### Regex tables to tag entities

- **Inductive:** Add entity strings that frequently appear in the data to regex tables.  
- **Iterative:** Add to regex tables as humans identify new entities or new aliases for known entities. Update data (Google Sheets) to speed up hand coding.

<!--### Add to regex tables as hand coders identify new aliases-->

The `legislators` package adds name variants (e.g., "Liz Warren") to standard legislator names.

```{r legislators, eval = FALSE}
library(legislators)

  select(Entity = bioname, Pattern = pattern) |>
  mutate(Pattern = Pattern |>

           str_remove_all("na |\\|herring, e\\\b|\\|herring, elizabeth|\\|liz herring|\\|warren, l\\\\b") %>% 
           str_replace("representative fletcher\\\\b.\\{1,4\\}tx", "\\|representative fletcher") %>% 
           #str_replace("fletcher\\|fletcher", "fletcher") %>%

### Next steps: 

Methods   
- Compare exact entity linking (regex tables) to probabilistic methods (`linkit`, `fastlink`, supervised classified with hand-coded training set)
- Compare exact grouping (e.g., by policy demands) to supervised probabilistic classifiers/clustering

Substantive   
- Test policy receptivity using rates of addressing Climate and EJ out of sample (direct rules & notices)
- Better measures of policy change
- Alternative estimation (hierarchical Bayes)
- Cumulative effects over time (hazard models)
- Placebo test?

I collected all 40 million comments on these draft and final rule pairs. 
Almost 5 million mentioned EJ.

The top row of plots with the purple border shows proposed rules that did address EJ; I use this set to assess whether EJ language changed between the draft and the final. 

The lower two rows in the red box show proposed rules that did not address EJ, and the middle row shows rules where EJ language was added. 

Each point is a rule. 
Blue ones are the ones where commenters raised EJ concerns. 
Red ones are where no comments raised EJ concerns.
Y-axis is the total number of comments the rule received.

Using n-gram matching methods similar to plagiarism detection, I collapse form letters and petitions into representative texts. As most comments are form letters, that 5 million collapses to 28 thousand unique texts.
This figure shows the percentage of shared text in a sample of documents.
The black squares on the diagonal show that each comment has a perfect overlap with itself. 
The block of grey partial matches reflects a public pressure campaign, with a lot of shared 10-grams. 
I then attach these to lobbying coalitions by hand.

### Why EJ?

1. Variation in issue framing: "environmental" policy is inconsistently racialized +  inconsistently focused on *distributions* of costs and benefits

1. Distinct phrase (few false positives) without many synonyms (few false negatives)

1. E.O. 12898 "Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice" (1993)


$\Rightarrow$ Administrative Procedures Act lawsuits: 
> "environmental justice analysis can be reviewed under NEPA and the APA" (*Protect Our Communities Foundation v. Salazar* 2013; *Communities Against Runway Expansion, Inc. v. FAA* 2004)

???

Environmental Justice For All Act (2020) introduced by Senator Harris

The day after Biden's executive order was launched, Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO) and Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced the Environmental Justice Mapping and Data Collection Act of 2021, which builds on many of the concepts in the executive order and would create a whole-of-government initiative, including data infrastructure and funding to “identify communities most at risk from environmental injustices.”

### *Distributive Claims Hypothesis*: 

> Policymakers are more likely to address distributive justice when groups raise distributive justice concerns.

 $\color{\green}{\checkmark}$ Pro: "norms and values are set communicatively" (Habermas 1996), "identifying interests" shapes policy (Gellhorn 1972)   

$\Large\color{\red}{\unicode{10007}}$ Con: Bureaucratic policymaking is about "technical expertise" (Epstein et al. 2014)

???
First, we might expect policymakers are more likely to address distributive justice when groups raise distributive justice concerns.

Conversely, if bureaucratic policymaking is about "technical expertise"

---

### *Coalition Size Hypothesis*

> Policymakers are more likely to address concerns as more groups raise them.

✅ :
Coalition size (Nelson and Yackee  2012) & pressure (Gillion 2013; Wasow 2020)

❌ : "Informational value" (Epstein et al. 2014; Gailmard & Patty 2017; Libgober 2018)

???

On the one hand, we might expect policymakers to respond to the scale of pressure to address EJ.

On the other hand, all of the formal models to date are focused on providing new information. 
I really like Brian Libgober's model of how comments inform rulemaking, but it relies on telling policymakers something they didn't already know. 

---

### *Policy Receptivity Hypothesis*

> Policymakers that more frequently address certain concerns will be more responsive to groups raising those concerns.

<!-- "Legibility" (Scott 1998), -->
✅ : "Opportunity structure" (Marks & McAdam 2007; McAdam 2010) "fit inside the legal narrative" (Scott 1998; Deloria 2009; Hilson 2002; Delaney 2017)   

❌ : "New information" Farina (2018)

???
Regarding policy receptivity
Political opportunity may not just be about access to policymakers but also in terms of political receptivity to the claims being made." (Hilson 2002, p. 242)

Claims may be more impactful when they are more legible to policymakers and fit inside their existing legal narrative and self-concept of what their job is.

Other legal scholars and formal models suggest that information should matter most when it is not something policymaker is already thinking about. If they are right, then we should expect the opposite---that activists raising EJ concerns are most influential at agencies that DON'T usually think about EJ---where it presents them with something new.

---

### *Public Attention Hypothesis*

> Policies are more likely to change when they receive more public attention (e.g., more public comments).

✅ : Leech (2010)

❌ : Lowery (2013), Balla et al. (2020)

???

Finally, there is this debate over whether high or low-salience policies are more likely to change. 

We might expect that policies are more likely to change when there is more overall public attention, regardless of pressure to address EJ in particular. 

On the other hand, if it is easier to lobby out of the public spotlight, we might expect low-salience policies to be more likely to change. 

Balla et al.'s study of responses to comments in rulemaking suggests a null effect. Legal scholars tend to see the scale of public attention is just not a legal concern. 

And again, formal models don't really have a parameter for public attention or pressure.

### Example: EPA responds to comments 

2013 Obama EPA proposed rule: *Air Quality State Implementation Plans; Approvals and Promulgations: Navajo Nation; Regional Haze Requirements for Navajo Generating Station* 

- No mention of climate change, one paragraph on environmental justice.

In response to 421 comments raising climate justice concerns, the final rule added nine paragraphs on environmental justice and a brief mention of climate change: 

> "EPA agrees that climate change is an important issue...Although regulation of greenhouse gases is conducted under separate statutory requirements from regional haze."


<!--, EPA is mindful that this BART determination for NGS is not the only regulatory program that affects this facility and the region."-->

---

### Example: EPA ignores comments

2017 Trump EPA proposed rule: *State of Texas, Regional Haze and Interstate Visibility Transport Federal Implementation Plan* makes no mention of climate change. 
<!--
 "Texas' participation in the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule’s (CSAPR) trading program for ozone-season NOX qualifies as an alternative to BART. We are approving Texas’ determination that its EGUs are not subject to BART for particulate matter (PM)."
-->
A short EJ section mentions only SO2, not NOX or PM.

61 Comments, including EarthJustice et al.: 

> "Climate change may also have an effect on the outdoor air pollutant concentrations, especially ozone."

The final rule makes no mention of climate change and no change to the EJ section.

The EPA believes that this action does not have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority populations, low-income populations, and/or indigenous peoples, as specified in Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994). We have determined that this rule will not have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or low-income populations because it increases the level of environmental protection for all affected populations without having any disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on any population, including any minority or low-income population. The rule limits emissions of SO

25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases emitted per year pursuant to
subpart W of part 98 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR part 98), regardless of the
reporting threshold under that subpart.” An “applicable facility” is defined under CAA section

### Variation across coalitions (OLS): $Y_{i} = \beta_{1:n} X_i +  \gamma_k + \delta_p + \epsilon_{ik}$  

$Y_i$ is the success of each coalition $i$  [-2:2]
on rule $j$, by agency $k$ under president $p$.  
 
  
$X_i$ includes
- whether the coalition is more than one organization [0,1]
- whether the coalition is business-led [0,1]
- whether the coalition's issue frame was adopted [0,1]
- the number of organizations in that coalition 
- whether the coalition supports the proposed rule [0,1]
- whether the coalition mobilized a pressure campaign  

$\gamma_j + \delta_p$ are fixed effects  
$\epsilon_{ik}$ errors clustered at agency level


???
As each coalition is unique to a rule, and each rule is unique to an agency and president, $y_{ijkp} \equiv y_i$   

The dependent variable, $Y$, is the lobbying success of each coalition. To estimate the relationship between a coalition's lobbying success and the scale of public pressure it mobilizes, I model the success of each coalition $i$ lobbying a rule $j$ published by an agency $k$ under a president $p$. Each coalition is unique to a rule; each rule is unique to an agency (I assigned joint rules to the lead agency only) and presidential administration. I thus use the simpler notation $y_i$ rather than the equivalent, more specific notation $y_{ijkp}$. 

The main variable of interest is the total number of form-letter public comments that a lobbying coalition mobilized.
The base model (Equation \@ref(eq:success)) uses an indicator for whether coalition $i$ used a public pressure campaign, i.e., mobilized mass comments (by definition, more than 99 mass comments). $\beta_1$ estimates the difference in lobbying success when coalition $i$ uses a pressure campaign compared to when it does not. Other models use either the logged number of comments or a quadratic term to account for the different marginal effects of additional public comments for smaller and larger campaigns. 


\begin{equation} 
Y_{i} = \beta_1 \textbf{Pressure campaign}_{i} + \beta_{2:n} X_i +  \gamma_j + \delta_p + \epsilon_{i} (\#eq:success)
\end{equation} 


The base models include agency and president fixed effects ($\gamma_k + \delta_p$) and control for other coalition-level factors that may affect a coalition's lobbying success, $X_i$. Controls include <!-- of the relative length of the (lead) organizations comment, -->
whether the coalition is lobbying unopposed, the coalition's size (the number of distinct organizations and elected officials), and the type of coalition (e.g., whether it is a business coalition or a public-interest coalition). $\beta_{2:n}$ are the effects of these other coalition-level factors on lobbying success. I estimate these relationships using OLS regression. <!--I also estimated hand-coded lobbying success with beta regression and ordered logit, which is more appropriate but less interpretable. For the automated measures of lobbying success, I estimate beta regression models with the same variables.-->
