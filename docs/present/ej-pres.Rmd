Hi, my name is Devin Judge-Lord; I'm a postdoc at Harvard Univ.
But today I am zooming in from down the coast on the homeland of the Lenape poeple.
I am so grateful to be able to share this with you.
- My work is at the intersection of two literatures that have not had much contact...On the one hand, social movements and civic engagement have long been a core interest of political scientists. We are highly uncertain about the size of effects from actions like letter writing, signing petitions, and protests, but there is little doubt that these things matter at a large enough scale.
- On the other hand, bureaucratic policy processes like agency rulemaking are often discussed as if they operate with a technocratic rationality. In a sense, mass politics is missing from a lot of the administrative law literature and even from political science theories and formal models of bureaucratic policymaking. 
- The paper I am presenting today is a small part of a larger book project:

<mark>Getting policymakers' attention and framing policy debates</mark>

Substantive policy influence

↓

Surviving judicial review


???

It is a middle step in the causal chain from mobilization to substantive policy influence. 
As I turn this chapter into an article,
I am struggling to include just enough and not too much of what comes before and after.

I need enough about mobilization to be clear about who is empowered.

I need enough on substantive policy influence to be honest about the limited power of framing and discourse effects in any one policy fight. 
But, this paper is really about the aggregate effects of many linked campaigns on the discourse and issue frames in the policy process---that is, how a movement affects policymaking 
across institutions and over time.

---

## Preview

Public pressure affects policy debates.

???
Today, I'm going to show that public pressure can affect the policy process, but with a lot of caveats. And the caveats are often the most interesting part. 
The first caveat is that baseline rates of addressing EJ are very low from the Clinton through the Trump administrations. 

There is a lot of potential for change, which is a tough road for the movement, but helpful for the scientist trying to measure change.
--

- Policymakers rarely addresses EJ concerns (across administrations)
--
, but they are much more likely to address EJ when pressured
--
, especially **receptive policymakers** who have **not already taken a position**.

???
- With larger EJ coalitions and more public attention, agencies are more likely  📈 to **add** EJ language **where there was none**
- BUT agencies also anticipate public attention, making **existing** EJ analyses less likely 📉 to **change** on higher-salience rules.

???
The second caveat is that pressure matters to receptive policymakers--policymakers who are used to thinking about ej at institutions with organizational processes for addressing EJ. 

Third is that the scale of public attention makes policymakers more likely to address EJ when they did not, but higher-salience policies that already addressed EJ are less likely to change. I suspect this is because agency officials have already dotted their i's and crossed their t's in these cases, and there is little room left for policy to move. 

--

HOWEVER, groups raising EJ are usually "big green" (White) advocacy organizations.  
--

- Big greens are much more likely to have their substantive policy demands met than tribes or frontline EJ groups.

???

Finally, assessing the normative implications requires us to understand who is advocating for whom. In the case of comments on federal agency rules, it is "big green" national advocacy groups that have historically led a very White environmental movement. 
These "big greens" are more likely to get substantive policy demands met than Tribes and frontline community groups. So, a lot hinges on the extent to which these national organizations represent EJ communities.

???
The EJ movement began in local resistance to toxic waste in places like the  Alt-geld Gardens housing complex on Chicago's South Side, where activists like Hazel Johnson had been organizing tenants years before a young Barak Obama showed up in 1984. Surrounded by manufacturing and toxic waste dumps, this neighborhood got the nickname "the toxic doughnut" 

--


# The EJ Frame

- Emerged in local campaigns against toxic waste sites and pesticides
- Began appearing in federal policy documents in the 1980s
- A fusion of the American Indian Movement, Chicano movement, farmworker movement, civil rights movement, and union organizing

> People of color [raised] social justice concerns such as self-determination, sovereignty, human rights, social inequality, loss of land base, limited access to natural resources, and disproportionate impacts of environmental hazards and linked them with traditional working-class environmental concerns such as worker rights and worker health and safety to develop an environmental justice agenda. (Taylor 2012, p. 1)

???

Dorcetta Taylor describes how black-led campaigns like Johnson's fused with the American Indian Movement, Chicano, and farmworker movements and drew on the civil rights and union organizing to push the EJ frame onto the national policy agenda 
and EJ began appearing in federal documents in the 1980s. 

My aim add some more systematic quantative data on the broad trends about the influence of EJ movment on the federal policy agenda that Taylor and others have mapped.

## Do Social Movements Cause Policy Change?

**Yes.** (Dahl 1956; Lipsky 1968; Piven & Cloward 1977; Tarrow 1994; Andrews 1997; McAdam 1982, 2001; McAdam & Su 2002, McCammon et al. 2011; Cress & Snow 2000; Weldon 2002)



- **Activists shape parties** (Cohen et al. 2008, Schlozman 2015, Skocpol & Williamson 2016)



- **Petitioning government builds movements** (Carpenter 2021)



- **Redistributive policies often require social movements** (Lowi & Nicholson 2015)



- **Protests affect policy by informing** (Gillion 2013, Gause 2022) **and seed policy agendas** (Wasow 2020)



- **No movement, no policy** (Skocpol 2013)

???

The big question is whether social movements impact policy.

- There is a lot of research on social movements, much of it from sociology, but political scientists tell us that social movements do 
- shape party agendas
- that the act of petitioning the government builds power
- In Lowi's words, "redistributive policies have been associated with social classes and movements from the beginning"--some kinds of policy only come about when groups form and mobilize to affect policy
- We don't know a lot about policy outcomes, but there is some great work showing specific policy effects of civil rights protests, for example.
- And as Theda Skocpol found in her study of why climate legislation failed, a movement is often a necessary condition for policy change

Despite excellent recent work (like Dan Gillion and Omar Wa-So's work on civil rights protests, Jamila Michener), there is still demand for a better understanding of the role of social movements in policymaking. 

---


## Research tends to explain social movement emergence rather than specific impacts (McAdam 2017) 

- **"limited research on [social movement] influence"** (Andrews & Edwards 2004)

- **The DV is rarely specific policy outcomes or systematic impact**


???
In the paper I note some of the great work in political science studying the impact of social movements on policy change, but much of the systematic work focuses on explaining mobilization. Movement activity and structure are the typical DVs. 


--

## My DV: Systematic impact on specific policy documents (**agency rules**)

???
I am trying to add to recent work on policy impact by looking systematically at change in very specific policy documents---executive branch agency rules, which now make up 90% of US law; 

Whether executive branch agencies are implimenting recent legislation or using authorty of centry-old statutes,  Rulemaking is where the teeth of federal law are forged and reforged over time.

So, I'm interested in the extent to which social movements can affect agency rulemaking.

--

## Aggregate impact of EJ campaigns across institutions and over time $\rightsquigarrow$ EJ movement impact

???
And I'm thinking about social movement impact as the aggregate impact of EJ campaigns across institutions and over time. 

Put differently, 
Whom does notice and comment rulemaking empower?

## Whom does notice and comment rulemaking empower? 

--

### If groups build the power to pass a Green New Deal, what happens when 30+ agencies write the actual policies? 

???
For example, if a GND is passed, what happens when dozens of agencies write the implementing rules?

Or consider that the Biden Administration has pledged to spend 40% of climate and energy spending, including the infrastructure bill in disadvantaged and EJ communities. There is much discussion this week because the administration omitted race from the definition of an EJ community because they are worried the courts will block it. 

Even without BBB or a GND, the Biden Harris administration is taking major policy action through rulemaking.

--

### Will organized public pressure carry over to agency policymaking? 
--
If so, by what mechanisms?

- General level of public attention?

- Specific pressure on issues like EJ?

- Targeting more receptive institutions?


???
Will organized public pressure carry over to agency policymaking? 

- If so, what kinds of politics are influential. Is it general attention? Is it specific pressure groups like environmental justice activists?

- are some institutions more receptive to pressure on EJ than others? 

This is where I turn to the literature on bureaucratic politics. 

---

## Theory: Information is the currency of lobbying.

### Scholars focus on *technical* information (see Yackee 2019)

- Bureaucratic policymaking, especially, is about expertise (Wagner 2010)

--

### Does *political* information matter?

- Coalition size? (Nelson and Yackee 2012 find it does)

- Who is affected? (Lowi would say it should)

- Public pressure/attention? (Balla et al. 2020 find that "legal imperatives trump political considerations")

???

Everything we know about lobbying, especially lobbying in agency rulemaking, tells us that information is the currency of lobbying. 

Information causes policymakers to change their minds, *especially* when policymakers are experts and lawyers.

Indeed, research shows that business groups dominate lobbying in rulemaking *because* they can generate and provide relevant information. 

Thus far, by "information," scholars generally mean technical and legal information.

- I ask about the role of a different kind of information--what we might call political information, building on Nelson and Yackee's finding that coalition size matters, we might also wonder if groups raising distributive claims would matter (Lowi would say so) and whether public pressure or public attention matters. Here scholarship is skeptical. Balla et al. concluded that mass comment campaigns don't matter "legal imperatives trump political considerations." in responding to comments. That technocratic rationality dominates, meaning that political information is not affecting the policy process. I want to test this claim. 

When I state my hypotheses, I put them in the direction that EJ campaigns do affect policy, while noting equally powerful intuitions going the other direction. 
I really think there are good intuitions going both ways. 
These are very much two-tailed tests. 

---

### *Distributive Claims Hypothesis*: 

> Policymakers are more likely to address distributive justice when groups raise distributive justice concerns.

✅ Pro: "norms and values are set communicatively" (Habermas 1996), "identifying interests" shapes policy (Gellhorn 1972)   


❌ Con: Bureaucratic policymaking is about "technical expertise" (Epstein et al. 2014)

???
First, we might expect policymakers are more likely to address distributive justice when groups raise distributive justice concerns.

Converely, if bureaucratic policymaking is about "technical expertise"

--

### *Repeated Claims (Coalition Size/Pressure) Hypothesis*

> Policymakers are more likely to address concerns as more groups raise them.

✅ :
Coalition size (Nelson and Yackee  2012) & pressure (Gillion 2013; Wasow 2020)

❌ : "Informational value" (Epstein et al. 2014; Gailmard & Patty 2017; Libgober 2018)

???

On the one hand we might expect policymakers to respond to the scale of pressure to address EJ.

On the other hand, all of the formal models to date are focused on providing new information. 
I really like Brian Libgober's model of how comments inform rulemaking, but it relies on telling policymakers something they didn't already know. 

---

### *Policy Receptivity Hypothesis*

> Policymakers that more frequently address certain concerns will be more responsive to groups raising those concerns.

<!-- "Legibility" (Scott 1998), -->
✅ : "Opportunity structure" (Marks & McAdam 2007; McAdam 2010) "fit inside the legal narrative" (Scott 1998; Deloria 2009; Hilson 2002; Delaney 2017)   

❌ : "New information" Farina (2018)

???
Regarding policy receptivity
Hilson argues that 
> "[Political opportunity] must be seen not just in terms of openness (in other words, access to the administration), but also in terms of political receptivity to the claims being made." (Hilson 2002, p. 242)

Cliams may be more impactful when they are more legible to policymakers and fit inside their existing legal narrative and self-concept of what their job is.

Other legal scholars and formal models suggest that information should matter most when it is not something policymaker is already thinking about. If they are right, then we should expect the opposite---that activists raising EJ concerns are most influential at agencies that DON'T usually think about EJ---where it presents them with something new.

---

### *Public Attention Hypothesis*

> Policies are more likely to change when they receive more public attention (e.g., more public comments).

✅ : Leech (2010)

❌ : Lowery (2013), Balla et al. (2020)

???

Finally, there is this debate over whether high or low salience policies are more liklely to change. 

We might expect that policies are more likely to change when there is more overall public attention, regardless of pressure to address EJ in particular. 

On the other hand, if it is easier to lobby out of the public spotlight, we might expect low-salience policies to be more likely to change. 

Balla et al's study of responses to comments in rulemaking suggests a no effect. Llegal scholars tend to see the scale of public attention is just not a legal concern. 

And again, formal models don't really have a paremeter for public attention or pressure. 

SKIPPING 
*Conditional Attention Hypothesis*

> Policies are more likely to address an issue when they receive more public attention (e.g., more public comments) *and* groups raise that issue.

The day after Biden's executive order was launched, Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO) and Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced the Environmental Justice Mapping and Data Collection Act of 2021, which builds on many of the concepts in the executive order and would create a whole-of-government initiative, including data infrastructure and funding to “identify communities most at risk from environmental injustices.”

I collected all 40 million comments on these draft and final rule pairs. 
Almost 5 million mentioned EJ.

The top row of plots with the purple border shows proposed rules that did address EJ; I use this set to assess whether EJ language changed between draft and final. 

The lower two rows in the red box show proposed rules that did not address EJ, the middle row shows rules where EJ language was added. 

Each point is a rule. 
Blue ones are ones where commenters raised EJ concerns. 
Red ones are where no comments raised EJ concerns.
Y-axis is the total number of comments the rule received.

???

Using n-gram matching methods similar to plagiarism detection, I collapse form letters and petitions into representative texts. As most comments are form letters, that 5 million collapses to 28 thousand unique texts.
This figure shows the percent of shared text in a sample of documents.
The black squares on the diagonal show that each comment has a perfect overlap with itself. 
The block of grey partial matches reflects a public pressure campaign, with a lot of shared 10-grams. 
I then attach these to lobbying coalitions by hand.

???
Both of my DVs---adding EJ language and changing existing EJ language--are dichotomous, so I,m going to use logit regression. 

The main models use president and agency fixed effects, so I'm focusing on varation within presidental administrations and within agency, but I also assess differences across presidents and agencies by estimating the same models with indicators rather than fixed effects.

Becasue log odds coeficients are hard to interpret and because my models have interactions, I am going to skip the regression table, and just show you predicited probabilies.

???

Because, I expect decreasing marginal effects of additional comments, both overall (i.e., public attention) and those that mention EJ (coalition size), I use logged values. 

However, the conclusions are largely the same if I use a quadradic function instead. That analysis suggests that medium levels of attention are not so impactful. A small level of attention matters, and then it takes a very large amount of additional pressure to move things, which makes sense. For hypothesis testing, however, all of the effects are in the same direction, so I am going to present predicted probabilities from these models here.

- ✊🏿  Distributive Claims 📈 
- 📢  General Public Attention 📉 (when comments don't raise EJ)

## Results: To sum up, yes, movements matter

Strong framing effects, but substantive victories are rare and dominated by surrogates

|                                            | Add EJ Language | Change EJ Language |
| ------------------------------------------ | :--: | :--: |
| ✊🏿  Distributive Claims (EJ Concerns)     | 📈 | 📈 |
| ✊🏿 🔁  Coalition Size /  Pressure        | 📈 | 📈 |
| 🏛️  Policy Receptivity                             | 📈 | 📈 |
| 📢  General Public Attention               | 📈 | 📉 |


<!--| 📢x✊🏿 Specific (Conditional) Pressure            | 📉 | ❓ | -->

With larger coalitions and more public attention, agencies are more likely  📈 to **add** EJ language **where there was none**, BUT agencies also anticipate public attention, making **existing** EJ analyses less likely 📉 to **change** on higher-salience rules.

Carving out a paper: More or less on mobilization or hand-coded influence? 

Is the aggregate influence of related campaigns a defensible working deff of a social movement, or is there a better way of talking about this? 

co-framing (Baumgartner and Jones) 

<!--
Next Steps
- More on coalition structure and policy success, especially opposing coalitions
- Better (hand-coded) measures of policy change
- Model changes in texts that already discuss climate/EJ/CJ

Framing 
- More on how social movements may impact policy. Petitioning and protest? Lobbying?

- Test policy receptivity using rates of addressing EJ out of sample (direct rules & notices)
- Better measures of policy change
- cor(EJ Language, Lobbying Success)
- Alternative estimation (hierarchical Bayes)
- Cumulative effects over time (hazard models)
- Placebo test?
