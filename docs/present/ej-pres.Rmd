<!-- 
Hi, my name is Devin Judge-Lord; I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Wisconsin
This paper is the first bit of writing I've done for my dissertation on public pressure campaigns in bureaucratic policymaking, for example, mass comment campaigns.

It sets out concepts and measures for these occasional bursts of civic participation,
which I will then use to assess whether it matters. 

I am still workshopping these concepts and measures, so your comments will be decisive when I take this in the next few years. 

SLIDE

My dissertation is at the intersection of two kinds of literature that have not had much contact. 

On the one hand, civic engagement has long been a core interest of political scientists. We are highly uncertain about the size of effects from actions like letter writing, signing petitions, and protests, but there is little doubt that these things matter at a large enough scale.

## Do Social Movements Cause Policy Change?

--

**Yes.** (Dahl 1956; Piven & Cloward 1977; Lipsky 1968; Tarrow 1994; Andrews1997; McAdam 1982, 2001; McAdam & Su 2002, McCammon et al. 2011; Cress & Saus 2000; Weldon 2002)

--

- **Activists shape parties** (Cohen et al., 2008, Schlozman 2015, Skocpol & Williamson 2016)

--

- **Petitioning government builds movements** (Carpenter 2021)

--

- **"From the very beginning, redistributive policies have been associated with social classes and social movements"** (Lowi & Nicholson 2015)

--

- **Protests affect policy** (Gillion 2013) 

--

- **No movement, no policy** (Skocpol 2013)

---

## Research tends to explain social movement emergence rather than specific impacts (see McAdam 2017) 

- **"limited research on [social movement] influence"** (Andrews & Edwards 2004)

- **The DV is rarely specific policy outcomes or systematic impact**

--

## My DV: Systematic impact on specific policy documents: **agency rules**

---

## Whom does notice and comment rulemaking empower? 

--

### If groups build the power to pass a Green New Deal, what happens when 30+ agencies write the actual policies? 

--

### Will organized public pressure to carry over to agency policymaking? 
--
If so, by what mechanisms?

- General level of public attention?

- Specific pressure on issues like EJ?

---

## Information is the currency of lobbying

### Scholars focus on *technical* information (see Yackee 2019)

- Bureaucratic policymaking, especially, is about expertise (Wagner 2010)

--

### Does *political* information matter?

- Coalition size? (Nelson and Yackee 2012 find it does)

- Who is affected? (Lowi would say it should)

- Public pressure/attention? (Balla et al. 2020 find that "legal imperatives trump political considerations")

---

### *Distributive Information Hypothesis*

> Policymakers are more likely to address distributional justice when commenters raise distributional justice concerns.

--

### *Repeated Information (Coalition Size) Hypothesis*

> Policymakers are more likely to address concerns when more commenters raise them.

--

### *Policy Receptivity Hypothesis*

> Policymakers that more frequently address certain concerns will be more responsive to commenters raising those concerns.

---

### *General Pressure Hypothesis*

> Policies are more likely to change when they receive more public attention (e.g., more public comments).

--

### *Specific (Conditional) Pressure Hypothesis*

>Policies are more likely to address an issue when they receive more public attention (e.g., more public comments) *and* some comments raise that issue.

---

## Why EJ?

1. Variation in issue framing: "environmental" policy is inconsistently racialized +  inconsistently focused on *distributions* of costs and benefits

--

1. Distinct phrase (few false positives) without many synonyms (few false negatives)

--

1. E.O. 12898 "Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice"
--
--> Administrative Procedures Act lawsuits: 
> "environmental justice analysis can be reviewed under NEPA and the APA" (*Protect Our Communities Foundation v. Salazar* 2013; *Communities Against Runway Expansion, Inc. v. FAA*, 2004)

`“Addressing disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations.”`

---

## Example of Policy Change: Safe Levels of Mercury 
--
(For Whom?)


- 2000 Notice: "the U.S. population."

--

- 2002 Draft: Regulated entities + "Other types of entities not listed could also be
affected."

--

- 2011 Draft: Five pages of analysis of the disparate impacts
on "vulnerable populations" including "African Americans," "Hispanic,"
"Native American," and "Other and Multi-racial" groups.

--

- 2012 Final Rule: + "minority, low income, and indigenous populations."
--

- 2020 Rollback: "While these communities may experience forgone benefits as a result of this action, the potential forgone [health benefits] are small." 

---

## Data: ~25,000 Policy Documents

12,257 Draft and Final Rule Pairs* across 40 agencies that published rules addressing EJ from 1993-2020

```{r ej-data, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "100%"}

knitr::include_graphics("ej-data-ejfr-1.png")  
```

*A few rulemaking dockets have more than one draft or final rule.

---

## Data: ~42,000,000 Public Comments

~4,800,000 (~28,000 unique) comments raise EJ concerns

```{r ej-comments, out.width = "75%"}

knitr::include_graphics("ej-comments-1.png")
```

## Next

Framing 
- More on how social movements' may impact policy
- Better names for hypotheses? *Distributive Information*?

Methods
- Cluster errors 
- Add rates of addressing EJ out of sample (direct rules & notices)
- Better measures of policy change (% of words changed, changes in word frequencies, etc.)

Substance
- Other terms/movements ("climate change"/"racial"/"minority populations"/"low-income"...others?)
