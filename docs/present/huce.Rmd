## Motivation

- Large majorities want stronger environmental policy

- Massive youth and activist energy behind climate and environmental justice

- Policy fights don't end with legislation

- But agency policymaking is technocratic  
$\rightarrow$ hostile terrain for mass politics and activism  
$\rightarrow$ good for incumbent industries


???

Legal theorists debate the normative value of public participation in agency rulemaking.
The role of agency policymaking in a large democracy unsettled

Big push from this administration increase participation and democratize agency decision-making, but the aim is unclear

Moreover, Bureaucratic inertia frustrates any "all of government" initiatives

As a political scientist, I take a more empirical large-scale quantitative approach to figure out the potential and limits of activism targeting agencies


---

## The IRA fight isn't over 

"energy community".  
$\rightarrow$ already [300+ pages of guidance from Treasury](https://arcgis.netl.doe.gov/portal/apps/experiencebuilder/experience/?id=a2ce47d4721a477a8701bd0e08495e1d) &  [maps from DOE](https://energycommunities.gov/energy-community-tax-credit-bonus/)

"disadvantaged community"   
$\rightarrow$ "a community that the Secretary determines [is] disadvantaged"

"life cycle emissions" <!--$\rightarrow$ "additional"/"new" generation -->    
$\rightarrow$ $0 – ∞ billion for hydrogen

"facility"   
$\rightarrow$  0 – massive reductions in methane

The other day I mentioned work I'm doing with my mentor Dan Carpenter here on how the banks successfully pushed back on financial regulation after the financial crisis and Dodd-Frank Act by lobbying the regulatory agencies. 

There may be lessons here for how powerful incumbent interests responding to the IRA and especially if we get more regulatory legislation.

## When does public pressure affect agency rulemaking? 


Campaigns succeed when

1. They have broad **public support** & **showing support is easy**

???

Public support can be a resource. Presidents "go public" to get their agenda through Congress. Similarly, activists mobilize public attention when it shifts politics in their favor. 

--
1. They have **experts and lawyers**

--
2. They **shift the terms of debate** or **mobilize elected officials**

--
2. The agency has **capacity** (e.g. to address climate or environmental justice issues)


???

Pushing back against some of the skepticism about pressure.
It can help, but only in certain conditions
 involved, ideally both


The work that Carrie and Arie do at ELP is really important 

???
Framing values-based decisions as scientific may hurt more than it helps.

### Getting policymakers talking about climate & EJ

From 2005 to 2020

- 8% of relevant agency rules addressed climate change, 15% mentioned EJ 

- 20% of all public comments mentioned climate change, 12% mentioned EJ 

- 1000 supporters = ~ 65 percentage point increase in the probability that the agency addresses climate change, 46 percentage point increase that the agency addresses EJ 

- Responsiveness is surprisingly stable across administrations but varies wildly across agencies

TOM ALLEN 

 Mercury standards that protected the average person in the US did not protect certain minority communities, in this case, many native communities who traditionally ate a lot more fish. 

I grew up in Wisconsin, in the center of the great lakes, and despite Friday fish fries, these regulations probably protected people in my family, BUT 

And there is a large Hmong population that came over after the Vietnam war, and other commenters raised produced studies that certain southeast Asian immigrant populations like the Hmong also ate a lot of freshwater fish and thus had higher rates of Mercury poisoning. Similarly,  Ojibwe people in the great lakes region had higher rates of mercury poising.

# The Environmental Justice Frame

???

What is environmental justice, and why does the Biden administration require 40% of federal spending to be spent in environmental justice communities? 

The EJ movement began in local resistance to toxic waste in places like the  Alt-geld Gardens housing complex on Chicago's South Side, where activists like Hazel Johnson had been organizing tenants years before a young Barak Obama showed up in 1984. Surrounded by manufacturing and toxic waste dumps, this neighborhood got the nickname “the toxic doughnut.” 

Dorceta Taylor describes how black-led campaigns like Johnson's fused with the American Indian Movement, Chicano, and farmworker movements and drew on civil rights and union organizing to push the environmental justice frame onto the national policy agenda. 

Began appearing in federal policy documents in the 1980s

My aim is to add some more systematic quantitative data on the broad trends regarding the influence of the EJ movement on the federal policy agenda that Taylor and others have mapped.

"Environmental justice" is a distinct phrase (few false positives) without many synonyms (few false negatives)

<!--

1. E.O. 12898 "Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice" (1993)

Why this matters:


- "Environmental" policy debates are rarely about *distributions* of costs and benefits

???

exclude: `r short`


- Reframing policy in distributive justice terms can shape normative, political, and economic analysis.

### Scholars of bureaucracy focus on *technical* information


???
- Bureaucratic policymaking, especially, is about expertise (Wagner 2010)


Everything we know about lobbying, especially lobbying in agency rulemaking, tells us that information is the currency of lobbying. 

Information causes policymakers to change their minds, *especially* when policymakers are experts and lawyers.

Indeed, research, including my own research elsewhere, shows that business groups dominate lobbying in rulemaking *because* they can generate and provide relevant information. 

Thus far, by “information,” scholars generally mean technical and legal information.

### Research tends to explain social movement emergence rather than specific impacts (McAdam 2017) 

- **“limited research on [social movement] influence”** (Andrews & Edwards 2004)
- **The DV is rarely specific policy outcomes or systematic impact**


???
In the paper, I note some of the great work in political science studying the impact of movements on policy change, but much of the systematic work focuses on explaining mobilization. Movement activity and structure are the typical DVs. 

<!--### My DV: Change in specific policies (agency rules)--> 

???
I am trying to add to recent work on the policy impact of movements and pressure campaigns by looking systematically at change in very specific policy documents.

Whether executive branch agencies are implementing recent legislation or using the authority of century-old statutes,  Rulemaking is where the teeth of federal law are forged and reforged over time.

So, I'm interested in the extent to which movements can affect agency rulemaking.

And I'm thinking about social movement impact as the aggregate impact of EJ campaigns across institutions and over time.

Using n-gram matching methods similar to plagiarism detection, I collapse form letters and petitions into representative texts. As most comments are form letters, that 5 million collapses to 28 thousand unique texts.
This figure shows the percentage of shared text in a sample of documents.
The black squares on the diagonal show that each comment has a perfect overlap with itself. 
The block of grey partial matches reflects a public pressure campaign, with a lot of shared 10-grams. 
I then attach these to lobbying coalitions by hand.

# Modeling the probability of policy change


###(1) Variation across agencies:

(\+ Interactions) 

--

###(2) Variation within agencies:  
Pr(Policy Change | President & Agency) ~ Policy Demands  \+  Coalition Size  \+  Public Attention
(\+ Interactions)


???
Both of my DVs---adding EJ language and changing existing EJ language--are dichotomous, so I m going to use logit regression. 

The main models use president and agency fixed effects, so I'm focusing on variation within presidential administrations and within the agency, but I also assess differences across presidents and agencies by estimating the same models with indicators rather than fixed effects.

Because log odds coefficients are hard to interpret and because my models have interactions, I am going to skip the regression table and just show you predicted probabilities. 


---


### (1.1a) Logit: $Y_i = \beta_{1:n} X_{i} + \delta_p + \epsilon_{ip}$

$Y_i$: the log odds of change in rule $i$ by agency $k$ under president $p$ <!--: $log[\frac{P(EJ\ in\ FR)}{1−P(EJ\ in\ FR)}]$-->

$X_{i}$: features of rule $i$
  - whether comments raise environmental justice

  - agency $k$'s share of prior draft rules mentioning environmental justice

  - the number of organizations raising environmental justice (logged)

  - the total number of comments (logged) $\times$ whether comments raise environmental justice
  
$\delta_p$: president fixed effects   
$\epsilon_{ip}$: cluster-robust errors by president

hereoskedasticity-robust standard-errors (White correction), where it is assumed that the errors are independent but the variance of their generative law may vary.

If vcov = "cluster", then arbitrary correlation of the errors within clusters is accounted for. Same for vcov = "twoway": arbitrary correlation within each of the two clusters is accounted for.

### (1.1b) Logit:  $Y_i = \beta_{1:n} X_{i} + \gamma_k + \delta_p + \epsilon_{ipk}$

$Y_i$: the log odds of change in rule $i$ by agency $k$ under president $p$ <!--: $log[\frac{P(EJ\ in\ FR)}{1−P(EJ\ in\ FR)}]$-->

$X_{i}$: features of rule $i$
  - whether comments raise environmental justice
  - the number of organizations raising environmental justice (logged)
  - the total number of comments (logged) $\times$ whether comments raise environmental justice

$\gamma_k + \delta_p$: president & agency fixed effects   
$\epsilon_{ipk}$: cluster-robust errors  by president & agency



???

Because I expect decreasing marginal effects of additional comments, both overall (i.e., public attention) and those that mention EJ (coalition size), I use logged values. 

However, the conclusions are largely the same if I use a quadradic function instead. That analysis suggests that medium levels of attention are not so impactful. A small level of attention matters, and then it takes a very large amount of additional pressure to move things, which makes sense. For hypothesis testing, however, all of the effects are in the same direction, so I am going to present predicted probabilities from these models here.

### U.S. federal agencies rarely address  environmental justice
--
, but they are much more likely to do so when pressured
--
, especially agencies with dedicated staff. 


--

### National advocacy organizations are more likely to have substantive policy demands met.

--

## Implications:


- Make it someone's job  
--

- Consider group representation   
--

- Hire lawyers  
--

- Mobilize allies and issue frames 


???

Finally, assessing the normative implications requires us to understand who is advocating for whom. In the case of comments on federal agency rules, it is “big green" national advocacy groups that have historically led a White environmental movement. 
These "big greens" are more likely to get substantive policy demands met than Tribes and frontline community groups. So, a lot hinges on the extent to which these national organizations represent EJ communities.

# Methods 




---

Human coding and computational text analysis are more powerful when combined in an iterative workflow.
<!--I show how search and text-reuse tools can aid common hand-coding tasks. 
Human coding can both inform and be informed by rule-based information extraction---iteratively structuring queries on unstructured text.-->

1. Text analysis tools can strategically **select texts for human coders**---texts representing larger samples and outlier texts of high inferential value.
2. Preprocessing can **speed up hand-coding** by extracting features like names and key sentences. 
3. Humans and computers can iteratively **tag entities** using regex tables 
<!--(e.g., identify organizations)--> and **group texts by key features** (e.g., identify lobbying coalitions by common policy demands)

---

Applying simple search and text-reuse methods to public comments on all U.S. federal agency rules, a **sample of 10,894 hand-coded comments** yields **41 million as-good-as-hand-coded comments** regarding both the organizations that mobilized them and the extent to which policy changed in the direction they sought. <!--This large sample enables new analyses of lobbying coalitions, social movements, and policy change.-->

Workflow: `googlesheets4` allows analysis and improving data in real time. For example: 

- The "org_name" column is populated with a guess from automated methods. As humans identify new organizations and aliases, other documents with the same entity strings are auto-coded to match human coding.   
- As humans identify each organization's policy "ask," other texts with the same ask are put in their coalition.   
- If the organization and coalition become known, it no longer needs hand coding.

# Grouping with key phrases

1. Humans identify groups of selected documents (e.g., lobbying coalitions)
2. Humans copy and paste key phrases
3. Computer puts other documents containing those phrases in the same group (coalition)

<!--**Digitized text** allows humans to paste text exactly matching machine-read strings.  -->
**Summaries** speed hand-coding (e.g., use `textrank` to select representative sentences).

### Regex tables to tag entities

- **Inductive:** Add entity strings that frequently appear in the data to regex tables.  
- **Iterative:** Add to regex tables as humans identify new entities or new aliases for known entities. Update data (Google Sheets) to speed up hand coding.

<!--### Add to regex tables as hand coders identify new aliases-->


**Fig 2:** Iteratively Building Regex Tables

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.show='hold'}
#knitr::include_graphics("https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRSJJgSbMdFtkpJjB94Tw5cmFElhDKrHEkOLaUb5-qFdIY-sQp4qGyC-FZoZ7UmWSLfoMZDueAkemhU/pub?w=752&h=238")

#knitr::include_graphics(here::here("legislators" , "man", "figures", "logo.png") %>% str_remove("dissertation"))
```

The `legislators` package adds name variants (e.g., "Liz Warren") to standard legislator names.

```{r legislators, eval = FALSE}
library(legislators)

members |>
  filter(first_name == "Elizabeth", congress == 117) |>
  select(Entity = bioname, Pattern = pattern) |>
  mutate(Pattern = Pattern |> 
           str_replace_all("\\\\b" , "\\\\\\\\b") %>% 
           str_remove_all("na |\\|herring, e\\\b|\\|herring, elizabeth|\\|liz herring|\\|warren, l\\\\b") %>% 
           str_replace("representative fletcher\\\\b.\\{1,4\\}tx", "\\|representative fletcher") %>% 
           #str_replace("fletcher\\|fletcher", "fletcher") %>% 
           str_replace("senator warren\\\\b.\\{1,4\\}ma", "\\|senator warren") |>
  str_replace_all("\\\\b", "\\\\\\b") )%>% 
  kable( caption = 'Regex Table for Legislators Named Elizabeth in the 117th Congress', full_width = T)|>
  kableExtra::kable_paper()
```


For example, the `legislators` package uses a regex table, adding variants (e.g., "AOC") to standard legislator names to detect them in messy text.

### Next steps: 

Methods   
- Compare exact entity linking (regex tables) to probabilistic methods (`linkit`, `fastlink`, supervised classified with hand-coded training set)
- Compare exact grouping (e.g., by policy demands) to supervised probabilistic classifiers/clustering

Substantive   
- Test policy receptivity using rates of addressing Climate and EJ out of sample (direct rules & notices)
- Better measures of policy change
- Alternative estimation (hierarchical Bayes)
- Cumulative effects over time (hazard models)
- Placebo test?

I collected all 40 million comments on these draft and final rule pairs. 
Almost 5 million mentioned EJ.

The top row of plots with the purple border shows proposed rules that did address EJ; I use this set to assess whether EJ language changed between the draft and the final. 

The lower two rows in the red box show proposed rules that did not address EJ, and the middle row shows rules where EJ language was added. 

Each point is a rule. 
Blue ones are the ones where commenters raised EJ concerns. 
Red ones are where no comments raised EJ concerns.
Y-axis is the total number of comments the rule received.

Using n-gram matching methods similar to plagiarism detection, I collapse form letters and petitions into representative texts. As most comments are form letters, that 5 million collapses to 28 thousand unique texts.
This figure shows the percentage of shared text in a sample of documents.
The black squares on the diagonal show that each comment has a perfect overlap with itself. 
The block of grey partial matches reflects a public pressure campaign, with a lot of shared 10-grams. 
I then attach these to lobbying coalitions by hand.

### Why EJ?

1. Variation in issue framing: "environmental" policy is inconsistently racialized +  inconsistently focused on *distributions* of costs and benefits

1. Distinct phrase (few false positives) without many synonyms (few false negatives)

1. E.O. 12898 "Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice" (1993)


$\Rightarrow$ Administrative Procedures Act lawsuits: 
> "environmental justice analysis can be reviewed under NEPA and the APA" (*Protect Our Communities Foundation v. Salazar* 2013; *Communities Against Runway Expansion, Inc. v. FAA* 2004)

???

Environmental Justice For All Act (2020) introduced by Senator Harris

The day after Biden's executive order was launched, Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO) and Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced the Environmental Justice Mapping and Data Collection Act of 2021, which builds on many of the concepts in the executive order and would create a whole-of-government initiative, including data infrastructure and funding to “identify communities most at risk from environmental injustices.”

### *Distributive Claims Hypothesis*: 

> Policymakers are more likely to address distributive justice when groups raise distributive justice concerns.

 $\color{\green}{\checkmark}$ Pro: "norms and values are set communicatively" (Habermas 1996), "identifying interests" shapes policy (Gellhorn 1972)   

$\Large\color{\red}{\unicode{10007}}$ Con: Bureaucratic policymaking is about "technical expertise" (Epstein et al. 2014)

???
First, we might expect policymakers are more likely to address distributive justice when groups raise distributive justice concerns.

Conversely, if bureaucratic policymaking is about "technical expertise"

---

### *Coalition Size Hypothesis*

> Policymakers are more likely to address concerns as more groups raise them.

✅ :
Coalition size (Nelson and Yackee  2012) & pressure (Gillion 2013; Wasow 2020)

❌ : "Informational value" (Epstein et al. 2014; Gailmard & Patty 2017; Libgober 2018)

???

On the one hand, we might expect policymakers to respond to the scale of pressure to address EJ.

On the other hand, all of the formal models to date are focused on providing new information. 
I really like Brian Libgober's model of how comments inform rulemaking, but it relies on telling policymakers something they didn't already know. 

---

### *Policy Receptivity Hypothesis*

> Policymakers that more frequently address certain concerns will be more responsive to groups raising those concerns.

<!-- "Legibility" (Scott 1998), -->
✅ : "Opportunity structure" (Marks & McAdam 2007; McAdam 2010) "fit inside the legal narrative" (Scott 1998; Deloria 2009; Hilson 2002; Delaney 2017)   

❌ : "New information" Farina (2018)

???
Regarding policy receptivity
Political opportunity may not just be about access to policymakers but also in terms of political receptivity to the claims being made." (Hilson 2002, p. 242)

Claims may be more impactful when they are more legible to policymakers and fit inside their existing legal narrative and self-concept of what their job is.

Other legal scholars and formal models suggest that information should matter most when it is not something policymaker is already thinking about. If they are right, then we should expect the opposite---that activists raising EJ concerns are most influential at agencies that DON'T usually think about EJ---where it presents them with something new.

---

### *Public Attention Hypothesis*

> Policies are more likely to change when they receive more public attention (e.g., more public comments).

✅ : Leech (2010)

❌ : Lowery (2013), Balla et al. (2020)

???

Finally, there is this debate over whether high or low-salience policies are more likely to change. 

We might expect that policies are more likely to change when there is more overall public attention, regardless of pressure to address EJ in particular. 

On the other hand, if it is easier to lobby out of the public spotlight, we might expect low-salience policies to be more likely to change. 

Balla et al.'s study of responses to comments in rulemaking suggests a null effect. Legal scholars tend to see the scale of public attention is just not a legal concern. 

And again, formal models don't really have a parameter for public attention or pressure.

### Example: EPA responds to comments 

2013 Obama EPA proposed rule: *Air Quality State Implementation Plans; Approvals and Promulgations: Navajo Nation; Regional Haze Requirements for Navajo Generating Station* 

- No mention of climate change, one paragraph on environmental justice.

In response to 421 comments raising climate justice concerns, the final rule added nine paragraphs on environmental justice and a brief mention of climate change: 

> "EPA agrees that climate change is an important issue...Although regulation of greenhouse gases is conducted under separate statutory requirements from regional haze."


<!--, EPA is mindful that this BART determination for NGS is not the only regulatory program that affects this facility and the region."-->

---

### Example: EPA ignores comments

2017 Trump EPA proposed rule: *State of Texas, Regional Haze and Interstate Visibility Transport Federal Implementation Plan* makes no mention of climate change. 
<!--
 "Texas' participation in the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule’s (CSAPR) trading program for ozone-season NOX qualifies as an alternative to BART. We are approving Texas’ determination that its EGUs are not subject to BART for particulate matter (PM)."
-->
A short EJ section mentions only SO2, not NOX or PM.

61 Comments, including EarthJustice et al.: 

> "Climate change may also have an effect on the outdoor air pollutant concentrations, especially ozone."

The final rule makes no mention of climate change and no change to the EJ section.

The EPA believes that this action does not have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority populations, low-income populations, and/or indigenous peoples, as specified in Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994). We have determined that this rule will not have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or low-income populations because it increases the level of environmental protection for all affected populations without having any disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on any population, including any minority or low-income population. The rule limits emissions of SO

25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases emitted per year pursuant to
subpart W of part 98 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR part 98), regardless of the
reporting threshold under that subpart.” An “applicable facility” is defined under CAA section

???
As each coalition is unique to a rule, and each rule is unique to an agency and president, $y_{ijkp} \equiv y_i$   

The dependent variable, $Y$, is the lobbying success of each coalition. To estimate the relationship between a coalition's lobbying success and the scale of public pressure it mobilizes, I model the success of each coalition $i$ lobbying a rule $j$ published by an agency $k$ under a president $p$. Each coalition is unique to a rule; each rule is unique to an agency (I assigned joint rules to the lead agency only) and presidential administration. I thus use the simpler notation $y_i$ rather than the equivalent, more specific notation $y_{ijkp}$. 

The main variable of interest is the total number of form-letter public comments that a lobbying coalition mobilized.
The base model (Equation \@ref(eq:success)) uses an indicator for whether coalition $i$ used a public pressure campaign, i.e., mobilized mass comments (by definition, more than 99 mass comments). $\beta_1$ estimates the difference in lobbying success when coalition $i$ uses a pressure campaign compared to when it does not. Other models use either the logged number of comments or a quadratic term to account for the different marginal effects of additional public comments for smaller and larger campaigns. 


\begin{equation} 
Y_{i} = \beta_1 \textbf{Pressure campaign}_{i} + \beta_{2:n} X_i +  \gamma_j + \delta_p + \epsilon_{i} (\#eq:success)
\end{equation} 


The base models include agency and president fixed effects ($\gamma_k + \delta_p$) and control for other coalition-level factors that may affect a coalition's lobbying success, $X_i$. Controls include <!-- of the relative length of the (lead) organizations comment, -->
whether the coalition is lobbying unopposed, the coalition's size (the number of distinct organizations and elected officials), and the type of coalition (e.g., whether it is a business coalition or a public-interest coalition). $\beta_{2:n}$ are the effects of these other coalition-level factors on lobbying success. I estimate these relationships using OLS regression. <!--I also estimated hand-coded lobbying success with beta regression and ordered logit, which is more appropriate but less interpretable. For the automated measures of lobbying success, I estimate beta regression models with the same variables.-->

### Within organizations (OLS): $Y_{ij} = \beta_{1:n} X_{ij} + \alpha_i + \gamma_k + \delta_p + \epsilon_{ij}$

$Y_i$: success of each organization $i$ [-2:2]
on rule $j$ by agency $k$ under president $p$.  

$X_{ij}$: features of organization $i$'s coalition on for each rule $j$ 
  - whether the organization is part of a coalition [0,1]
  - whether their coalition is business-led [0,1]
  - whether the coalition's issue frame was adopted [0,1]
  - the number of organizations in their coalition 
  - whether the coalition supports the proposed rule [0,1]
  - whether the coalition mobilized public pressure [0,1]   
  
$\alpha_i + \gamma_j + \delta_p$: fixed effects   
$\epsilon_{ij}$: errors clustered at the organization level

???

As each rule is unique to an agency and president, $y_{ijkp}$ $\equiv$ $y_{ij}$

Unlike congress, the key variable that explains the relationship between wealth and influence appears to be the ability to hire lawyers and experts.
