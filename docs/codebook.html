<p>A position will eventually be identified for all comments, but the first step is to identify the positions of comments by organizations and elected officials (other comments are generally identified automatically from textual similarity).

<li>“2” Opposed to the change, prefers no change, though they might be ok with some change</li>
<li>“3” Supports the rule change, but asking for less (e.g., “we applaud EPA’s efforts to regulate …, but would prefer less severe limits” or “The Guild recognizes the need to have uniform regulations which the proposed rules address. Still, the Guild takes issue with some of the proposed changes”)</li>
<li>“4” Supports the rule change as is</li>
<li>“5” Supports the rule change but asking for more</li>
<li>“6” Opposed to the rule change for not going far enough (e.g. " While the proposed rule may improve current protections to some degree, it is utterly inadequate…If the agency fails to revise the rule to incorporate such measures, then they should withdraw the proposed rule completely"
<a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/NOAA-NMFS-2020-0031-0668" class="uri">https://www.regulations.gov/comment/NOAA-NMFS-2020-0031-0668</a>)</li>
<li>“0.” Only if there is really no position of any kind on the policy</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a commenter can support a rule that is moving in a deregulatory direction. This means that they oppose regulation and thus support the rule (because the rule is rolling back regulation). What matters here is their position on the change from the status quo (current policy) to the proposed rule, not on regulation in general. These positions correspond to a commenter’s ideal policy (their “ideal point” in the policy space). If a commenter’s ideal policy is at position 1 in the figure below, the proposed rule change is moving policy in the opposite direction they want it to move, hence their position is “opposed to the rule change for moving in the wrong direction.” Similarly, if the current policy (the status quo) is a commenter’s ideal policy, their ideal point is at or near the current policy (x1), position 2, and they are opposed to the proposed rule change.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>If the commenter’s ideal policy is at positions 3, 4, or 5, these ideal policies are closer to the new policy, X2 than the current policy X1, and thus they are likely to support the rule change. If the commenter’s ideal policy is at position 6, the change from X1 to X2 is insufficient for them to support it (even though it is technically moving in the direction they would like). This is rare, but commenters do occasionally reject proposed rules for doing too little. Their hope is that by rejecting this proposed policy (even though it moves policy in their preferred direction), they might get a better policy later.</p>

<p>“1” = fairly certain (may also be left blank), “2” = unsure, “3” = totally unclear</p>
<hr />
<p><code>coalition_comment</code> = Is this commentator lobbying alongside other commenters in a fashion that suggests they are a coordinated coalition? If so, put the name of one of the other main organizations in the coalition here and use this for all comments with compatible asks. Coalitions may be implicit (compatible asks, even if they don’t mention the other orgs) or explicit (e.g. “In terms of specific reservations about the proposed changes, we associate ourselves with the letter from ACLU”). There may often be only one coalition commenting on a rule (especially for rules with few comments). It is harder to identify the sides of a debate where only one side shows up, but we must be careful not to artificially break up essentially aligned interests just to have a conflict between commenters. The conflict that matters is generally on the main dimension(s) of conflict at issue in the policy. If everyone is 3s and 4s (or 1s and 2s) they will more often all be one big coalition pushing generally in the same direction with compatible asks than several smaller ones pushing in different incompatible directions. Position and coalition are not synonymous, but they are highly correlated.</p>
<p><code>coalition _type</code> =<br />
The key distinction here is typically whether the lead organizations will profit from the coalition’s advocacy (even if some of the orgs in the coalition are nonprofits)</p>
<ul>
<li>“public” if this coalition is primarily lobbying on behalf of some idea of the public interest (two organizations lobbying on the same rule may have opposing ideas of the public interest, but oftentimes public interests conflict with private interests)<br />
</li>
<li>“private” if this coalition is mainly on behalf of private interests (even if not their own or if using language evoking the public interest, as most lobbying does)</li>
</ul>
<p><code>comment_type</code> =</p>
<ul>
<li>“org” any kind of organization making substantive suggestions<br />
</li>
<li>“elected” Is this comment from an individual elected official (e.g., U.S. House or Senate). Add a specific type of elected official after a semicolon "elected; house, elected; senate, elected; governor, elected; state senate, county commissioner, etc.<br />
</li>
<li>“individual” an individual who is writing in their personal capacity, not on behalf of an organization or office (even if they use an organization’s letterhead), and is not part of an organized petition-like campaign<br />
</li>
<li>“corp campaign” a form letter used by many (often small) businesses (org_name and org_type will still be the org (e.g. the name of the small business and “corp;small business”)<br />
</li>
<li>“mass” a petition-like campaign
<ul>
<li>“mass;grassroots” - individuals who genuinely care<br />
</li>
<li>“mass;astroturf” campaigns are intended to create a deceptive appearance of public support. The group organizing the campaign is only doing so because they are being paid. The individuals mobilized are often either deceived (e.g., intentionally misled about the policy or its likely effects) or financially incentivized to participate. In the extreme, astroturf campaigns may use the names of fake or non-consenting individuals. In contrast, a more grassroots campaign may also require funding, but groups would choose to use resources for such a campaign even without the quid pro quo, and individuals are mobilized based on some pre-existing interest or belief. While grassroots campaigns may involve simplification, spin, and even mild deception, it is not decisive to the campaign. If you find yourself thinking “why are these people supporting this company/industry?” it might be astroturf.<br />
</li>
<li>“mass;corp campaign” - genuine support/opposition from a large number of businesses, often small businesses.</li>

<div id="if-comment_type-org" class="section level3" number="6.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">A.1.1</span> If <code>comment_type</code> = “org”:</h3>
<p><code>org_name</code> = the name of the organization. This column will often be filled in automatically with an algorithm’s best guess. Please revise these names to be the clearest, standardized, and unique version of the organization’s name.</p>
<p>If more than one org signed the comment, try to pick the main organizer (e.g., the one whose letterhead is used). If unclear, go with an org we have seen before (this will increase the chances it is linked to the right set of lobbying coalitions). If still unclear, go with the first signatory. When more than one org signed the comment, add “; coalition” to the end of whatever <code>org_type</code> codes you give it.</p>
<p><code>org_type</code> = the type of organization, “corp”/“corp group”/“gov”/“ngo” etc. (create additional codes as needed). Definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>“corp” = individual business (add subtypes as applicable, corp;small business, corp;coop, corp;law firm;bank;financial firm)<br />
</li>
<li>“corp group” = “business interests” (members or representatives of a trade association);<br />
</li>
<li>“gov” = government interests (“gov;state” “gov;local” “gov;federal” “gov;tribal” ’gov;regional" or “gov;foreign”) within the United States. If states (e.g. Governors or Attorneys Governor), list out all states in org_name.<br />
</li>
<li>“ngo” = non-business and non-government interests.<br />
Use a semicolon to indicate subtypes, such as:<br />
“Ngo;advocacy”<br />
“Ngo;legal”<br />
ngo;professional (e.g. an association of doctors or other professionals)<br />
“Ngo;philanthropy”<br />
“Ngo;union”<br />
“ngo;credit union”<br />
ngo;pressure group (a group mobilizes pressure campaigns)<br />
“ngo;membership organization” (org that has members)<br />
“ngo;university”<br />
“Ngo;thinktank” (an organization that does policy-oriented research)<br />
“Ngo;church”
<ul>
<li>“ngo;ej” Does this org represent an Environmental Justice/frontline community? I.e. are they based in an affected community (see description of “second-order representation” here: <a href="https://judgelord.github.io/dissertation/ej.html#interest-groups-and-second-order-representation" class="uri">https://judgelord.github.io/dissertation/ej.html#interest-groups-and-second-order-representation</a>)
There are many additional sub-types of ngo, including advocacy groups, membership groups, professional associations, foundations, charities. These are not mutually exclusive. Use a semicolon to separate multiple tags.
Some 501c3s are industry associations; they should be coded as a “corp group.” However many ngos that are not clearly a corp group still advocated for private interests. For example, the Chamber of Commerce represents business interests generally and thus ends up being a member of many private-interest coalitions, even though they may not explicitly be commenting on behalf of a regulated industry as an industry association would.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“other” = If the org really in no way in any of the above (e.g. a foreign government)</li>
</ul>
<p><code>ask</code> =<br />
The text of the comment (e.g., a sentence) that best captures the overall ask.</p>
<p><code>ask1</code>, <code>ask2</code>, <code>ask3</code> =<br />
The text of the comment’s top three (if there are three) specific asks or objections (e.g., the proposed rule text they object to or would like to be changed.) If a comment responds to several issues within a rule, try to select the main ask from each of the top 3 issues, not just the first 3 issues they address. For example, if the organization “opposes” or “supports” several proposed changes, but “strongly opposes” or “strongly supports” other proposed changes, that may indicate which issues they care most about. Ultimately, you must put yourself in the organization’s shoes, think about their mission and their members, and decide which of the issues they raise are most important to them. Identify the clearest statements of their top 3 aims and include all surrounding text that is on topic for that ask.</p>
<p>If there is only a general sentiment, <code>ask1</code> can be the same <code>ask</code> (with <code>ask2</code> and <code>ask3</code> left blank, as they are any time there is not more than one detailed request).</p>
<p><code>success</code>, <code>success1</code>, <code>success2</code>, <code>success3</code> (corresponding to <code>ask</code>, <code>ask1</code>, <code>ask2</code>, <code>ask3</code>)</p>
<ul>
<li>“2” if, overall, the final rule ended up mostly where requested<br />
</li>
<li>“1” if, overall, the rule ended somewhat close to that requested<br />
</li>
<li>“0” if no adverse changes, but also no requests met, or if the request is moot. A request may become moot if superseded by another request. For example, if a group requests that the rule is withdrawn, but if not, changed, then withdrawal makes the requested changes moot. Note: If no changes were requested (they requested the rule be published as is), then no adverse changes is actually a 2)<br />
</li>
<li>“-1” if the rule ended up somewhat different/opposite than requested<br />
</li>
<li>“-2” if the rule ended up significantly different/opposite than requested</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that “-1” and “-2” can include rules being published without requested changes or withdrawn when the group would prefer the rule not to be withdrawn.</p>
<p><code>success_certainty</code> =<br />
“1” = fairly certain (may also be left blank), “2” = unsure, “3” = totally unclear</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Asks and success should focus on the change from the proposed to the final rule. For example, if an org likes a rule, but asks that it goes further, and then the rule is rolled back somewhat, this would be an adverse change and thus a -1. If a rule that an org liked was withdrawn, it would be a -2. If they ask for it to be published as is and it is published as is, success is a 2. If they ask for it to be strengthened and it is published as is that is a 0. If their asks are a mix of “stay the course” and “strengthen” and the rule is published without change, we might code that a 0 or a 1 depending on how important the changes demanded were. If their main emphasis was on keeping policy provisions in the proposed rule, no change is a moderate success.</p>

<li>“mass;astroturf” = individuals who were mobilized by a well-resourced group to create an impression of public support/opposition<br />

<p>If your sheet has a <code>transparency</code> column, code whether the campaign was transparent about its<br />
“sponsor”
“signers”
“both” or
“neither”</p>
<p>Generally, it obvious from the letter who they are and how we might verify that.
A bunch of names with no contact info is not very transparent, but if they say “these are all members of our org,” that is good enough if we needed to verify. Agencies occasionally post one representative comment for a campaign; this should not be held against an org if they also provided the others, we could get them if needed.
If a sponsor gives their phone number but not their org, that is not enough. If you have to research to find the org name, that is not transparent. If they submit under a misleading org name, that is also not transparent. I have mostly seen this in corp campaigns, where they try to disguise who paid for the campaign.</p>

## Coding an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM)
The main challenge to coding ANPRMs is that the agency’s goal is solely to get feedback on whether or not they should further develop the idea presented in the ANPRM. 


When an agency submits an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking, a few things can occur: 1) after receiving negative feedback, the agency could drop the idea without ever making it a proposal, 2) they could submit a supplemental advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to clarify points on their idea, or 3) after receiving positive feedback, create a real proposal. 


Depending on the public reception of the ANPRM, coding can become more challenging. For example, consider an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking with a supplemental advanced notice of proposed rulemaking that was withdrawn before becoming a real proposal. This creates challenges for assessing an organization’s position since the whole point of the ANPRM was to get comments and recommendations on the idea. So, to code these comments, we must decide how strongly an organization wanted the idea to be withdrawn or implemented. Some may be clear-cut, with organizations explicitly stating that they wanted it turned into a proposal or did not want the idea further developed. In those cases, coding `position` as 1 or 4 is straightforward. However, when an organization wanted to further develop the idea, deciding on a 3 or 5 depends on whether the organization liked that the agency was moving in the general direction proposed in the ANPRM. For example, a 3 would indicate that they wanted to reel it back a bit and were unfriendly in their comments. Alternatively, a 5 would indicate that an organization was pleased with the direction of the idea and wanted to strengthen it for a proposal. However, when an organization appeared to want to slow things down to redevelop an idea (but would have preferred for the idea to be withdrawn) in a clearly negative way, a 2 may be more appropriate. Doing a little background research on the organization and its goals may help to interpret how they would feel if the idea advanced to a proposal. 


Another challenge that you may run into is coding the success of asks. If the ANPRM is turned into a proposal, then you can identify whether or not the changes an organization requested were made in the NPRM. On the other hand, if the ANPRM does not advance to a proposal, identifying their success was based on their main ask. With no real proposal, there are no specifics to judge their position or success on certain asks. Therefore, its success was based on how the organization would feel if the idea was turned into a proposal.
