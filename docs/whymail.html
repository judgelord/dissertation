<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>I examine who participates in public pressure campaigns and why. Scholars of bureaucratic policymaking have focused on the sophisticated lobbying efforts of powerful interest groups. Yet agencies occasionally receive thousands, even millions of comments from ordinary people. How, if at all, should scholars incorporate mass participation into models of bureaucratic policymaking? Are public pressure campaigns, like other lobbying tactics, primarily used by well-resourced groups to create an impression of public support? Or are they better understood as conflict expansion tactics used by less-resourced groups? To answer these questions, I collect and analyze millions of public comments on draft agency rules. Using text analysis methods underlying plagiarism detection, I match individual public comments to pressure-group campaigns. Contrary to other forms of lobbying, I find that mass comment campaigns are almost always a conflict expansion tactic rather than well-resourced groups creating an impression of public support. Most public comments are mobilized by public interest organizations, not “astroturf” campaigns. However, resources do limit who can use public pressure tactics to larger policy advocacy organzations. Over 80% of the 48 million comments on proposed rules posted to regulations.gov were mobilized by just 100 organizations, 87 of which lobby in coalitions with each other. Contrary to other forms of political participation, I find no evidence of negativity bias in public comments. Indeed, from 2005 to 2017, most comments supported proposed rules. This is because public comments tend to support Democratic policies and oppose Republican policies, reflecting the asymmetry in mobilizing groups.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Participatory processes like public comment periods on draft policies are said to provide democratic legitimacy <span class="citation">(Croley <a href="#ref-Croley2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Rosenbloom <a href="#ref-Rosenbloom2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>, political oversight opportunities <span class="citation">(Balla <a href="#ref-Balla1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>; McCubbins and Schwartz <a href="#ref-McCubbins1984" role="doc-biblioref">1984</a>)</span>, and new technical information <span class="citation">(S. W. Yackee <a href="#ref-Yackee2006JPART" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>; Nelson and Yackee <a href="#ref-Nelson2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. The extent to which participatory processes serve these democratic, accountability, or technocratic goals depends on who participates and why.</p>
<p>In civics classrooms and Norman Rockwell paintings, raising concerns to government is an individual affair. Scholars, too, often focus on studying and improving the ability of individuals to participate in policymaking <span class="citation">(Cuéllar <a href="#ref-Cuellar2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>. But in practice, the capacities required to lobby effectively on matters of national policy are those of organized groups, not individual citizens.</p>
<!--PUZZLE-->
<p>Bureaucratic policymaking, in particular, is the ideal context for powerful organized interests to dominate. Policies made by specialized agencies are likely to have concentrated benefits or costs that lead interest groups, especially businesses, to dominate <span class="citation">(Lowi <a href="#ref-Lowi1969" role="doc-biblioref">1969</a>, <a href="#ref-Lowi1972" role="doc-biblioref">1972</a>)</span>. Agency policymakers are generally experts who are deeply embedded in the professional and epistemic networks of the industries they support and regulate <span class="citation">(Epstein, Heidt, and Farina <a href="#ref-Epstein2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. Organizations with superior resources often flood policymakers with technical information that is valued both by the specific legal context of bureaucratic policymaking and by technocratic rationality more broadly <span class="citation">(Wagner <a href="#ref-Wagner2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>. Agencies are generally framed as “implementers” rather than “makers” of policy. Even the most value-laden policy documents that are re-written under each subsequent president are framed as derivative of (often decades-old) legislative statutes. All of these features empower legal and technical experts and thus the organizations with the resources to hire them.</p>
<!--PUZZEL-->
<p>And yet, activists frequently target agency policymaking with letter-writing campaigns, petitions, protests,
and mobilizing people to attend hearings—all classic examples of “civic engagement” <span class="citation">(Verba and Nie <a href="#ref-Verba1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span>. While recent scholarship on agency policymaking has shed light on sophisticated lobbying, especially by businesses, we know surprisingly little about the vast majority of public comments, which are submitted by ordinary people as part of public pressure campaigns. As I show below, most comments submitted to regulations.gov are part of organized campaigns, more akin to petition signatures than “deliberative” participation or sophisticated lobbying. Importantly, however, nearly all comments are mobilized to support a more sophisticated lobbying effort. Without a systematic understanding of the scale and impact of public participation–<em>group-mediated</em> participation–in rulemaking, it is impossible to answer normative questions about how participatory processes like public comment periods may enhance or undermine various democratic ideals.</p>
<!--Not the ideal place for this?-->
<p>Surely, those who tend to engage are far from representative of the broader public <span class="citation">(Verba and Nie <a href="#ref-Verba1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span>. Still, in many ways, they must be more representative than the handful of political insiders who participate in most policy processes.
If the usual participants have “an upper-class accent” <span class="citation">(Schattschneider <a href="#ref-Schattschneider1942" role="doc-biblioref">1942</a>)</span>, does adding thousands of more voices dilute this bias? The answer depends on how people are mobilized. If the “usual suspects” mobilize public pressure to create an impression of public support, it may merely legitimize the demands of the same group of powerful interest groups that would dominate without broader engagement.</p>
<!--GAP-->
<p>While practitioners and administrative law scholars have long pondered
what to make of letter-writing campaigns targeting the bureaucracy, political scientists have had
surprisingly little to say about this kind of civic participation and the role of public pressure in bureaucratic policymaking. Much of our knowledge about civic participation beyond voting comes from surveys <span class="citation">(e.g., Verba and Nie <a href="#ref-Verba1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span> and qualitative studies of particular groups.
Models of bureaucratic policymaking focus on the participation of sophisticated lobbying groups and neither explain nor account for public pressure campaigns.
Civic engagement in general and organized public pressure in particular thus remain poorly understood in the context of bureaucratic policymaking.</p>
<!-- GAP IS SURPRISING -->
<p>Political scientists’ neglect of public pressure campaigns is surprising given that most people are only
aware of bureaucratic policymaking when it is the target of a public pressure campaign.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> While most policy processes receive little public attention,
the ease of online mobilizing and commenting has, like other forms of
participation <span class="citation">(Boulianne <a href="#ref-Boulianne2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, created exponential increases in the number of rules in which thousands and even millions of people engage.
<!--These bursts of civic participation may affect
rulemaking [@Coglianese2001], but this intuition has yet to be tested.-->
The general failure to explain and account for public pressure campaigns in models of bureaucratic policymaking is also striking in light of how agencies advertise public
comment periods as an opportunity for a voice in government
decisions.
The Regulations.gov
homepage solicits visitors to “Make a difference. Submit your comments
and let your voice be heard” and “Participate today!” (Figure <a href="whymail.html#fig:regsgov">2.1</a>. A blue “Comment Now!” button accompanies a short description of each draft
policy and pending agency action.
Public comment periods on proposed agency
rules are described as “an important part of democracy” (WSJ 2017),
“often held out as the purest example of participatory democracy in
actual American governance” <span class="citation">(Herz <a href="#ref-Herz2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Rossi (<a href="#ref-Rossi1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span> finds that “courts, Congress, and scholars have elevated participation in rulemaking to
a sacrosanct status…greater participation is generally viewed as
contributing to democracy.” (pg. 2)</p>

<!--fill gap-->
<p>To fill this gap, I bring scholarship on policy advocacy groups<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> into theories of bureaucratic policymaking. Doing so reveals competing intuitions about the drivers of public participation, which I assess using a large new dataset of participation in federal agency rulemaking.</p>
<!-- summary, usual suspects vs underdog. this could be shorter, longer below-->
<p>First, I develop and assess two theories of who should mobilize public pressure campaigns and why. Each theory has observable implications for which types of groups will run campaigns in different contexts. One stems from leading theories of bureaucratic decision-making and interest group lobbying. It predicts that groups with more resources will dominate all forms of lobbying, including public pressure campaigns. The other emerges from democratic theories. It predicts that groups with fewer material resources but more popular support will more often use public pressure campaigns.
The extent to which public comment periods serve the functions and provide the normative benefits that proponents assert depends on who participates. To begin to make sense of public participation in bureaucratic policymaking, I develop a typology of different kinds of participation, with implications for the normative value of participatory institutions. Because political participation is often a collective affair, this includes a typology of public pressure campaigns.</p>
<p>To the extent that public pressure campaigns drive participation, the normative value of participatory processes like public comment periods depends on who organizes these campaigns.
Suppose public pressure campaigns follow the usual patterns of interest group lobbying, where the groups with the most resources dominate. In that case, the procedural legitimacy they provide is merely a veneer masking the influence of powerful political insiders. Instead of encouraging political oversight, they would discourage it. Instead of diversifying the available information, they would merely reinforce powerful insiders’ claims and issue frames. We would expect a pressure campaign to push policy further in the direction desired by the most powerful insiders.
On the other hand, if the usual suspects do not dominate public pressure campaigns, participatory processes may yet improve the democratic credentials of American policymaking, expand political oversight, and diversify the information available to policymakers. To the extent that public pressure tactics empower groups who are usually left out of the policy process, pressure campaigns may blunt the influence of powerful insiders.
Thus, to understand the empirical effects or normative value of participatory processes like public comment periods, we first need to know who participates and why. To the extent that public participation is mobilized by campaigns, we need to know who is behind them.</p>
<p>Second, I offer a synthetic theory about the conditions under which we should see private and public interest group campaigns. I argue that public interest groups more often have incentives to launch public pressure campaigns than private interests. However, the resources required to run a campaign will lead a few large public interest groups to dominate. I argue that private interests have incentives to sponsor campaigns (including astroturf campaigns) under much more limited conditions. Pressure campaigns from private interests should thus be less common than campaigns from public interest groups.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>To assess these theories, I assemble a new dataset of thousands of public pressure campaigns that collectively mobilized millions of public comments across three administrations from 2005 to 2020. Using a mix of qualitative hand-coding and computational text analysis, I identify the coalitions of groups behind each campaign and the type of interest group they represent.</p>
<p>I find that mass participation in bureaucratic policymaking is better explained by theories of democratic institutions and conflict expansion rather than existing theories of bureaucratic policymaking. Participation is overwhelmingly driven by the policy advocacy efforts of a few public interest groups. Indeed, just 100 advocacy organizations mobilized over 80% of public comments (40 out of 50 million). Traditional membership organizations and individuals account for a smaller portion, and “astroturf” campaigns are rare, almost exclusively arising in opposition to a large public interest group campaign, as predicted by my theory.</p>
<p>I proceed in the following steps. Section <a href="whymail.html#why-theory">2.2</a> reviews the literature on civic engagement, democratic politics, and bureaucratic politics and then develops hypotheses about the causes of public engagement in bureaucratic policymaking. Section <a href="whymail.html#why-methods">2.3.2</a> introduces a novel dataset systematically capturing public participation in federal agency rulemaking. Section <a href="whymail.html#why-methods">2.3.2</a> outlines methods to assess my hypotheses using comments as large-n observational data. Section <a href="whymail.html#why-results">2.4</a> reviews the results of this analysis.</p>
<!--broaden public participation, political oversight, and relevant information--and their ultimate impact on policy depends on who organizes them. If 
<!--Observers often ask how effective public pressure campaigns are. From a political science perspective, the question is

Who are these well-resourced groups?  
Do they lobby in other venues (like congressional policymaking)?  
Why should we consider these very select groups and their actions democratizing?  Perhaps they – themselves – are quite elitist?  Take this question head-on.  Maybe digging into the literature on membership groups would help here.  
Are super mobilizers different from others?

Importantly, <span class="citation">Verba and Nie (<a href="#ref-Verba1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span> distinguish “citizen-initiated contacts” from “cooperative activity” (pg. 54).

By coordinating political action, public pressure campaigns expand civic participation in policymaking.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Self-selection may not be ideal for representation, but
opt-in participation—whether voting, attending a hearing, or writing a
comment—may often be one of the few heuristics decisionmakers have
about public preferences. Campaigns inform agencies about the
distribution and intensity of opinions that are often too nuanced to
estimate a priori. However limited and slanted, this information is directed at policymakers who may often be unclear how the public and other political institutions will react to their policy decisions. Many questions that arise in rulemaking lack
analogous public opinion polling questions, making mass commenting a
unique source of political information. As with public opinion on most
specific policy issues, most members of the public and their elected
representatives may only learn about the issue and take a position as a
result of a public pressure campaign <span class="citation">(Hutchings <a href="#ref-Hutchings2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Forms of civic participation beyond voting, such as protests and petitioning, offer unique opportunities for minority interests.

Policymakers learn and take informational cues from political behaviors like protests (<span class="citation">Gillion (<a href="#ref-Gillion2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>). <span class="citation">Carpenter (<a href="#ref-CarpenterPetitions" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> finds similar potential for petitions to serve as a channel to raise “new claims” and influence policy beyond elections: “Petition democracy offer another model of aggregation, where numerical minorities could still make a case of quantitive relevance” (pg. 479). Numbers matter for protests and petitions, regardless of whether they represent a majority. These modes of preference aggregation often claim to represent a substantial segment of the public, perhaps a larger portion than those as passionately opposed to them.</p>

<p>Advocacy organizations work together on campaigns. For example, “Save our Environment,” which collected signatures from hundreds of thousands of people, is a small nonprofit with a simple WordPress website almost entirely dedicated to mobilizing public comments. It is run by The Partnership Project, a coalition of 20 of the largest environmental advocacy organizations in the US, including the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, Greenpeace, and the World Wildlife Fund, with the aim of “harnessing the power of the internet to increase public awareness and activism on today’s most important environmental issues.” <!--Several Partnership Project members, including the Sierra Club, EarthJustice, and NRDC, also mobilized hundreds of thousands of their own supporters to comment separately.--></p>
<!-- move below to methods?--->
<p>Advocacy organizations often claim to represent a large number of “members and supporters” (e.g. <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/FWS-HQ-ES-2018-0007-47165">FWS-HQ-ES-2018-0007-47165</a>)
For example, in its comment on proposed regulations on internet gambling, the Poker Players Alliance claimed to represent “more than 840,000 poker enthusiast members” (TREAS-DO-2007-0015-0118). Many of these people became “members” when they signed up to play a free online poker game. However, the organization did claim to have mobilized over 150,000 letters to members of Congress, which, if true, would indicate a somewhat active membership.</p>
<p>The potential for “cheap talk” in claims of representation is a problem for the ability of groups to communicate credible political information.</p>
<p>To mobilized broader support, advocacy organizations often engage smaller organizations to mobilize their members as well. For example, in a campaign targeting fishing regulations, in addition to mobilizing thousands of individuals, the Pew Charitable Trusts mobilized members of the New York Underwater Photography Society and hundreds of restaurants that serve sustainable seafood. These smaller organizations did not identify themselves as part of Pew’s campaign, but their letters used almost identical language.</p>

For example, when presidents are in difficult negotiations with Congress, they often use their bully pulpit to mobilize segments of the public to pressure elected representatives. Likewise, interest groups mobilize segments of the public to policymakers as part of their lobbying strategy.
The ability to mobilize a large number of people can thus be a valuable political resource.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.5</span> Incorporating Political Information</h3>
<!--% MAIN QUESTION 
### Incorporating mass engagement into theories of bureaucratic policymaking.-->
<p>How, if at all, should scholars incorporate public pressure into models of bureaucratic policymaking?
Because the role that public pressure may play in policymaking depends on who mobilized it and why, the first task is to develop testable theories about the drivers of public participation.</p>
<p>In this section, I first develop two theories about the drivers of public participation in bureaucratic policymaking, one rooted in theories of group conflict and democratic politics and the other rooted in existing theories of interest-group lobbying in bureaucratic policymaking. I then offer a synthetic theory that specifies the conditions under which we should see different kinds of public pressure campaigns. I argue that mass engagement produces potentially valuable political information about the coalition that mobilized it. To the extent that groups aim to influence policy, public pressure is a compliment, not a substitute to sophisticated lobbying. Public pressure supports sophisticated lobbying. This can take several forms.</p>
<div id="ususal-suspects-or-underdogs" class="section level4" number="2.2.5.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.5.1</span> “Ususal Suspects” or “Underdogs”</h4>
<p>Political information may play two distinct roles in policymaking with opposite effects depending on who mobilized it. The normative and empirical import of public pressure campaigns thus turns on who is behind them.</p>
<p>To the extent that well-resourced groups (the “usual suspects”) use public pressure campaigns to create a misleading impression of public support (often called “astroturf”), their role is to strengthen and legitimize demands of the same powerful interests that dominate bureaucratic policymaking. Here, just as groups with superior resources use them to flood policymakers with technical information <span class="citation">(Wagner <a href="#ref-Wagner2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>, astroturf campaigns convert economic resources into political information in the form of an impression of public support generated by signatures or form letters. Even groups with few members or a narrow or non-existent base of support among the public may create the appearance of public support by sponsoring pressure campaigns. If the powerful business groups that dominate other forms of lobbying also dominate public pressure campaigns, these campaigns (and perhaps public comment periods themselves) are normatively suspect, merely providing a democratic veneer to economic power. Empirically, we would then expect public pressure campaigns to further advantage the most well-resourced interests.</p>
<p>Alternatively, to the extent that public interest groups use public pressure campaigns are used as conflict expansion tactics by less-resourced groups (“underdogs”), their role is the opposite: to push back against powerful interests that dominate bureaucratic policymaking. The political information created by conflict expansion can reveal existing and potential support among attentive segments of the public. Through public pressure campaigns, groups that lack financial resources can convert latent public support into concrete political information that may cause policymakers to update their beliefs and change their behavior.<br />
If mass commenting is mainly a vehicle for public interest groups to convert a latent base of public support into influential political information supporting their representational claims or shining light on the policy process, public comment periods may yet serve some of the informing, balancing, and democratic functions that practitioners and normative theorists desire. Empirically, we would then expect public pressure campaigns to disadvantage well-resourced interests that dominate most policy processes.</p>

First, I offer a framework for assessing the causes of mass engagement.
Next, I argue that organizations may mobilize large numbers of people
for several reasons with observable implications for observed patterns of
mass engagement and theoretical implications for predicted effects on

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.5.3</span> Public Pressure as a Resource</h4>
<p>An organization’s ability to expand the scope of conflict by mobilizing
a large number of people can be a valuable political resource <span class="citation">(Schattschneider <a href="#ref-Schattschneider1975" role="doc-biblioref">1975</a>, @Kollman1998)</span>.
In contrast to scholars who focus on the deliberative
potential of public comment processes, I focus on public engagement as a
tactic aimed at gaining power. Scholars who understand mobilization
as a tactic <span class="citation">(Furlong <a href="#ref-Furlong1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>; Kerwin and Furlong <a href="#ref-Kerwin2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> have focused on how
organizations mobilize their membership. I expand on this understanding of mobilization as a lobbying tactic to include the broader audiences that are often mobilized by policy advocacy organizations and pressure groups. The broader audiences mobilized through public pressure campaigns are more akin to the concept of
an attentive public <span class="citation">(Key <a href="#ref-Key1961" role="doc-biblioref">1961</a>)</span> or issue public <span class="citation">(Converse <a href="#ref-Converse1964" role="doc-biblioref">1964</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Here I build on three insights. First, <span class="citation">Furlong (<a href="#ref-Furlong1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Kerwin and Furlong (<a href="#ref-Kerwin2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>
identify mobilization as a tactic. The organizations that they surveyed
reported that forming coalitions and mobilizing large numbers of people
are among the most effective lobbying tactics. Second, <span class="citation">Nelson and Yackee (<a href="#ref-Nelson2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>
identify political information as a potentially influential result of
lobbying by different business coalitions. While they focus on
mobilizing experts, I argue that <span class="citation">Nelson and Yackee (<a href="#ref-Nelson2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> describe a dynamic that can be extended
to public pressure campaigns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“strategic recruitment, we theorize, mobilizes new actors to participate in the policymaking process, bringing with them novel technical and political information. In other words, when an expanded strategy is employed, leaders activate individuals and organizations to participate in the policymaking process who, without the coordinating efforts of the leaders, would otherwise not lobby. This activation is important because it implies that coalition lobbying can generate new information and new actors—beyond simply the ‘usual suspects’ —relevant to policy decisionmakers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding political information, I extend this logic extends to
non-experts. The number and distribution of ordinary supporters may
matter because it suggests a <em>public</em> consensus, at least among some segments of the attentive public. Instead of bolstering
<em>scientific</em> claims, a perceived public consensus bolsters <em>political</em>
claims. To understand why groups
organize public pressure campaigns, we must understand mass mobilization can be a tactic
aimed at producing political information.</p>
<p>While most scholars have emphasized the lack of useful technical information in mass comments, a few have raised their role in creating
political information. <span class="citation">Cuéllar (<a href="#ref-Cuellar2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> calls on agencies to pay more
attention to ordinary peoples’ expressions of preference and <span class="citation">Rauch (<a href="#ref-Rauch2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>
suggests that agencies reform the public comment process to include
opinion polls.</p>
<p>I build from a similar intuition that public pressure
campaigns currently function like a poll or, more accurately, a petition, capturing the intensity of preferences among the attentive
public—i.e., how many people are willing to take the time to
engage. Indeed, many campaigns use the language of public opinion and petitioning. For example, a campaign by the World Wildlife Federation provided
language explicitly claiming to have public opinion on their side.
Their model comment cited an opinion poll, stating that “Along with 80% of the American
people, I strongly support ending commercial trade in elephant ivory
in the U.S.” This suggests that public pressure campaigns aim to signal
information about public opinion.
A coalition led by another environmental group, Oceana, framed its mass mobilization effort to curb the
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s 2017 Proposed Offshore Oil and Gas
Leasing Program as a “petition signed by 67,275 self-proclaimed United
States residents,” suggesting that organizations consider some mass-comment campaigns to effectively be petitions. In the same statement, Oceana also claimed the
support of “more than 110 East Coast municipalities, 100 Members of
Congress, 750 state and local elected officials, and 1,100 business
interests, all of whom oppose offshore drilling,” suggesting that claims
of public and elected official support aim to provide similar kinds of
political information.</p>
<p>Public pressure campaigns reveal the intensity of passions in attentive segments of the public. Pressure campaigns may presage or co-occur with other efforts like protests and lobbying Congress, thus offering information about other likely political developments.</p>
<p>Building on theories of group conflict in democratic politics, I consider
public demands to be a latent factor in my model of policymaking (Figure
<a href="whymail.html#fig:causal-whymail">2.3</a>. Public demands shape the decisions of
groups who lobby. If they believe the attentive public could be rallied to their cause, groups may attempt to reveal this political information
to policymakers by launching a public pressure campaign. That is, the extent to which latent public demands align with a group’s demands will affect its lobbying strategy, specifically whether it decides to launch a public pressure campaign.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="whymail.html#fig:causal-whymail">2.3</a> amends the “Classic Model” of interest
group lobbying (Figure <a href="whymail.html#fig:causal-classic">2.2</a>) to incorporate public pressure campaigns and political information about the attentive public. <em>In addition to</em> providing technical information through sophisticated comments, an organization may mobilize supporters to produce political information. This is a key feature of the model: political information is mobilized <em>in support of</em> a lobbying coalition’s sophisticated legal or technical lobbying effort, not as an alternative to sophisticated lobbying.</p>
<p>The more latent public support a group has, the more successful this mobilization effort will be.
The public
response to the campaign (observed as the sale of public engagement in the policy process) depends on the extent that the attentive public
is passionate about the issue. A broader and more passionate attentive public will yield a larger scale of mass engagement than a narrower, less passionate segment base of public support. Thus the observed scale of mass engagement on a given side of a conflict can reveal political information about segments of the public. Large-scale engagement may produce several types of relevant political
information. The most direct and obvious is the expressed “public
opinion” that policymakers observe.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The causal process visualized in Figure
<a href="whymail.html#fig:causal-whymail">2.3</a> may only operate under certain conditions. For example, the success of a mobilizing effort depends on whether a group’s perception of latent public demands (the diagonal arrow between “Latent Public Demands” and “Lobbying Strategy”) reflects the public response to a mobilizing effort (the horizontal arrow between “Latent Public Demands” and “Mass Engagement”). Additionally, policymaking institutions have different mechanisms for processing and incorporating technical and political information (the arrows between “technical information” or “political information” and “policy response”).</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Because lobbying organizations likely have some idea of the level of public support for their positions, one observable implication of this model is that lobbying organizations will be more likely to launch a public pressure campaign when they have more public support (i.e., where latent public support is a resource).</p>
<p>Instead of a public pressure campaign aimed at mobilizing supporters, a lobby organization may attempt to bypass mass engagement by producing fake evidence of public support. However, as I describe below, this is a risky strategy.</p>
</div>
<div id="second-order-representation" class="section level4" number="2.2.5.4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.5.4</span> Second-order Representation</h4>
<p>When lobbying during rulemaking, groups often
make dubious claims to represent broad segments of the public
<span class="citation">(Seifter <a href="#ref-Seifter2016UCLA" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. If agency staff do not trust an organizations’
representational claims, engaging actual people may be one of the few
credible signals of a broad base of support. This is especially true when
organizations claim to represent people beyond their official members; comments may be the best way to support those claims.
For example, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a top mobilizer of public comments, often claims to represent “3 million members
and online activists” (<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/about" class="uri">https://www.nrdc.org/about</a>), presumably including anyone who has donated to or participated in one of its campaigns. Mobilizing comments is one way that NRDC can demonstrate actual support for their position on any given issue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if advocacy
group decisions are primarily made by D.C. professionals, these
advocates themselves may be unsure how broadly their claims resonate
until potentially attentive publics are actually engaged.</p>
<p>Theorists debate whether signing a petition of support without
having a role in crafting the appeal is a meaningful voice and whether
petitions effectively channel public interests, but, at a minimum,
engaging a large number of supporters may help broader interests to
distinguish themselves from truly narrower ones. It suggests that the
organization is not entirely “memberless” <span class="citation">(Skocpol <a href="#ref-Skocpol2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span> in the sense that it
can demonstrate some verifiable public support. An organization mobilizing its members or supporters to take some action lends weight to representational claims that might otherwise be indistinguishable from cheap talk claims that groups often make to represent broad constituencies.</p>
<p>The credibility of the signal that mass engagement provides may be complicated by “astroturf” campaigns, where organizations aim to evoke the image of a larger base of support than they really have. To the extent that support can be effectively faked or inflated using “astroturf” tactics, the political information that pressure campaigns provide will be less accurate and thus valuable to decisionmakers.</p>
<p>Astroturf campaigns that utilize faked evidence of mass support (e.g., faked petition signatures) bypass the public pressure and mass engagement step entirely, manifesting false political information. However, in a model where political information is a compliment to technical information, supporting a sophisticated lobbying effort, utilizing fake political information is a risky strategy. Organizations lobbying in repeated interactions with agencies, and an organization’s reputation–critical to its ability to provide credible technical information–may be severely harmed if policymakers lean that an organization provided false political information. One observable implication is thus that astroturf campaigns will often be used anonymously or by organizations that do not also engage in sophisticated lobbying in order to provide sophisticated lobbying organizations plausible deniability. Because policymakers may rationally discount petitions submitted anonymously or by groups that lack reputations for credibility, fraudulent campaigns have little hope of influencing policy in this model and may thus be fairly rare compared to a model where political information is not mediated by groups that also engage in sophisticated lobbying.</p>

</div>
<div id="types-of-pressure-campaign-motivations" class="section level3" number="2.2.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.6</span> Types of Pressure Campaign Motivations</h3>
<!--should this be in theory?-->
<p>The effects of public pressure campaigns depend, in part, on the aims of a
campaign. Campaigns may pursue four distinct aims: (1) to win concessions by <em>going public</em>, (2) to <em>disrupt a perceived consensus</em>, or (3) to satisfy some audience other than policymakers by <em>going down fighting</em> when they anticipate losing or (4) to satisfy some audience other than policymakers by <em>credit claiming</em> when they anticipate winning. Going public and disrupting a perceived consensus are, respectively, forms of proactive and reactive outside lobbying. Going down fighting and credit claiming to describe
situations where the organization mobilizes for reasons other than influencing policy, like engaging or recruiting members. In many cases, “going public” as a lobbying strategy is simultaneously an opportunity to engage and recruit members, so organizations <strong>going public</strong> to influence policy and engage in power-building tactics, especially <em>credit claiming</em>. For example, Sierra club organized several campaigns around thanking the Obama EPA for new draft environmental policies and the agency to not back down, thus simultaneously engaging members, implying that the Sierra Club had advanced its policy agenda, and pressure policymakers to hold course or strengthen policy rather than bend to countervailing industry pressures.</p>
<p><strong>Going public.</strong> Coalitions “go public” when they believe that
expanding the scope of conflict gives them an advantage. As coalitions that “go public” should believe they have more intense public
support, mass engagement is likely to skew heavily toward this side.</p>
<p>Going public is likely to be used by those disadvantaged (those
<span class="citation">Schattschneider (<a href="#ref-Schattschneider1975" role="doc-biblioref">1975</a>)</span> calls the ‘losers’) in a policy process with
less public attention.
Indeed, looking at a sample of rules from the Environmental Protection Agency, <span class="citation">Potter (<a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a><a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> finds that advocacy group-driven campaigns mobilize
far more people on average than industry-driven campaigns. Additionally,
many people may be inspired indirectly (e.g., through news stories) or
to engage with more effort (e.g., writing longer public comments) than people
mobilized by the side with less public support. This is important
because political information may be especially influential if
decisionmakers perceive a consensus. For example, the level of consensus among interest groups
<span class="citation">(Golden <a href="#ref-Golden1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>; S. W. Yackee <a href="#ref-Yackee2006JPART" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>, especially business unity
<span class="citation">(J. W. Yackee and Yackee <a href="#ref-Yackee2006JOP" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>; Haeder and Yackee <a href="#ref-Haeder2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, predicts policy change.^[It is not clear if the power of coalition unity is a result of strategic calculation by policymakers, a perceived obligation due to the normative power of consensus (e.g., following a majoritarian logic <span class="citation">(Dahl <a href="#ref-Dahl1989" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>; Mendelson <a href="#ref-Mendelson2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>), or simply that unified demands are easier to process than opposing demands.</p>
<p><strong>Disrupting a perceived consensus.</strong> I theorize that when coalitions
with less public support mobilize, it is a reaction to their opponents.
Because the impression of consensus is potentially powerful, when a coalition goes
public, an opposing coalition may countermobilize. Because these are coalitions with less intense public support, and their aim
is to prevent a perceived consensus, I expect such campaigns to engage
fewer people, less effort per person, and yield a smaller portion of
indirect engagement. In the extreme, these campaigns are astroturf, relying on various forms of deception to compensate for their lack of genuine public support.</p>
<p><strong>Credit claiming</strong> and <strong>going down fighting</strong>. Finally, campaigns may target supporters rather
than policymakers. When they expect to win, organizations may launch a campaign in order to draw attention to and associate themselves with a positive policy development. When they expect to lose, organizations may “go down fighting” to fulfill
supporters’ expectations. Both of these “performative” reasons for organizing a mass comment campaign may help engage existing members and recruit new members. For example, <span class="citation">Carpenter (<a href="#ref-CarpenterPetitions" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> finds that many anti-slavery petitions were this type of campaign, where “the most important readers of a
petition are its signatories” rather than the policymakers to whom they are addressed. “Credit claiming” and “going down fighting”
campaigns are rooted in logics that are internal to the organization,
including member retention or recruitment [<span class="citation">Carpenter and Moore (<a href="#ref-Carpenter2014b" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Carpenter (<a href="#ref-CarpenterPetitions" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>, fundraising, or satisfying a
board of directors. For example, as Figure <a href="whymail.html#fig:sierra">2.4</a> shows, the Sierra Club uses campaigns to collect
contact information of supporters and potential members. Given the executive-branch transition between 2010 when the rule was
initiated and 2017 when it was delayed, the Sierra Club may have had
little hope of protecting methane pollution standards, but for members
of the public who wanted to voice their opinion, the Sierra Club created
an easy way to do so, as long as users consented to “receive periodic
communication from the Sierra Club.”</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2.4: The Sierra Club Collects Contact Information Through Public Pressure Campaigns

</div>
<p>While more performative campaigns may engage many people, they are unlikely to affect
policy or inspire countermobilization. <!--I expect such campaigns to
occur on rules that have high partisan salience (e.g., rules following
major legislation passed on a narrow vote), rules that propose large
shifts on policy issues dear to member-funded public interest groups, or
rulemaking started shortly after presidential transitions when
executive-branch agendas shift more quickly than public opinion.--></p>
<p>When a lobbying coalition with more intense public support successfully
mobilizes for reasons other than influencing policy, opposing coalitions
with less public support have little reason to countermobilize. Thus, member-funded public interest groups should be more common than campaigns sponsored by narrow private interests, simply because they have more occasions where mobilizing has benefits. Most campaigns sponsored by narrow private interest should occur in opposition to another campaign, but public interest groups have reasons to launch a campaign when policy is unlikely to move, and thus private interests are unlikely to oppose them.</p>
<p>The extent to which a campaign genuinely aims to influence policy or is pursuing other logics may be difficult to distinguish in
the observed public response. Indeed, multiple motivations may drive most campaigns, and members of the public may poorly
understand the different chances of success in each case.
However, lobbying organization do likely know their chances of success and should
thus invest less in providing technical information when they see little opportunity to affect policy. By identify cases where coalitions engage in large
public campaigns without corresponding investment in Technica, we may be able to assess whether countermobilization and is indeed less
likely in these cases. Table

<p>As Table <a href="whymail.html#tab:campaigns-patterns">2.1</a> suggests, the relevant statistic
distinguishing patterns is the <em>relative</em> level of technical and political information provided by an organization or coalition. Even among rules targeted by
campaigns, salience varies significantly, and thus “high” and “low” numbers of comments will differ across rules.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.6.1</span> Public and Private Aims</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: MORE ABOUT PUBLIC VS PRIVATE COALITIONS TO SET UP HYPOTHESES. ESP. ADD MORE ABOUT PRIVATE COALITIONS’ RESOURCES</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While lobbying coalitions may form around various material and ideological
conflicts, those most likely to be advantaged by going public, credit claiming, or going
down fighting are public interest groups—organizations primarily
serving a broad idea of the public good rather than the narrow material interests of
their members. And indeed, <span class="citation">Potter (<a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a><a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> finds that advocacy group-driven campaigns mobilize
far more people on average than industry-driven campaigns. Thus, I theorize that mass mobilization is most
likely to occur in conflicts of public versus private interests or
public versus public interests (i.e., between coalitions led by groups
with distinct cultural ideals or desired public goods), provided they
have sufficient resources to run a campaign. If true, one implication is
that mass mobilization will systematically run counter to concentrated
business interests where they conflict with the values of public
interest groups with sufficient resources to mobilize.</p>
<p>Classifying coalitions as primarily driven by private or public interest provides analytic leverage, but scholars have not converged on a single approach to do so. <span class="citation">Potter (<a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a><a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> distinguishes “advocacy groups” from
“industry groups.” <span class="citation">Berry (<a href="#ref-Berry1999" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>)</span> calls these groups “citizen groups” and emphasizes conflict over cultural issues. Some public interest groups focus on conservative or progressive cultural issues, like religious education, immigration, or endangered species. Others are more focused on the public provision or protection of public goods such as national parks, consumer product safety standards, air quality, drinking water, and public safety. Types of membership organizations that are both broad and focused on material outcomes for their members (such as labor unions) are difficult to classify. <span class="citation">Potter (<a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a><a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> puts unions in the “Industry” category.
I take a different approach based on the coalition with whom such groups lobby. If a union lobbies alongside businesses <span class="citation">(see Mildenberger <a href="#ref-Mildenberger2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, I classify this as a private interest-driven coalition. If a union lobbies with
public interest groups on public health or safety issues, I classify
this as a public interest group coalition.</p>
<p>Another challenge for classifying public and private interest groups is that appeals to the government are almost always couched in the language of
public interest, even when true motivations are private
<span class="citation">(Schattschneider <a href="#ref-Schattschneider1975" role="doc-biblioref">1975</a>)</span>. Public pressure campaigns are no exception, and mobilizing organizations almost always evoke some version of the public interest. <!--However, not all... --></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="types-of-public-engagement" class="section level3" number="2.2.7">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.7</span> Types of Public Engagement</h3>
<p>I classify supporters into three types: minimal supporters, passionate supporters, and inspired supporters. The number and ratios of each describe key pieces of
political information. In the context of public
comments, minimal supporters submit comments that are exact copies of a form letter, essentially a petition signature. It is the minimal effort required to participate in a campaign. Commenters that also take time to add their own text to a form letter
indicate more intense preferences. For example, 37,127 commenters mobilized by EarthJustice submitted the same form, but 6,837 of them also added additional personalized comments. Mobilizing organizations often encourage their supporters to write personalized comments and emphasize the number of people who took the time to write personalized comments in their own comments.
<!--For example, Earthjustice noted the number of people who wrote personalized comments when it uploaded its mass comment campaign. "Attached is the file containing the names of 37,127 individuals who have submitted public comments urging the Environmental Protection Agency to ban organophosphate and carbamate pesticides. In addition to signing on in support of the following letter, 6,837 individuals of the total number have submitted personalized comments." ([EPA-HQ-OPP-2012-0161-0087](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OPP-2012-0161-0087))] --></p>
<p>Finally, commenters who express
solidarity in similar but distinct phrases indicate they were inspired
indirectly, perhaps by a news story or a social media post about the campaign, as campaign messages spread beyond those initially
targeted.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The size of each group offers political information to
policymakers, including coalition resources, the intensity of sentiment,
and the potential for conflict to spread. The first two types signal two
kinds of intensity or resolve. First, they show the mobilizers’
willingness to commit resources to the issue. Second, costly actions
show the intensity of opinions among the mobilized segment of the public
<span class="citation">(Dunleavy <a href="#ref-Dunleavy1991" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a>)</span>. The number of people engaged by a campaign is not
strictly proportional to an organization’s investment. The less people
care, the more it costs to mobilize them. The third type indicates
potential contagion. Indications that messages spread beyond those
initially targeted may be especially powerful <span class="citation">(Kollman <a href="#ref-Kollman1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Public pressure campaigns thus produce information about organizational resolve, the intensity of public demands, and the potential of the campaign or movement to grow.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.8</span> Hypotheses About the Drivers of Mass Mobilization</h3>
<p>The observable implications of the theory described above suggest several testable hypotheses.</p>
First, national politics in the United States is the terrain of organized groups. While observers frequently talk about ordinary people engaging in policymaking as individuals, political science theory suggests that the participation of individuals who are not professional policy influencers will almost always be mediated by an organized group.<br />
<!--2.1-->

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:meditated" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 2.1  </strong></span>Most people engage in the policy process as a result of organized public pressure campaigns.
</div>
<!--2.2-->
<p>I argue that public pressure tactics are a compliment, not a substitute for sophisticated technical lobbying. Whereas some previous studies compare mass comment campaigns to technical lobbying efforts, I argue that the relevant unit of analysis is the lobbying coalition and that public pressure is a compliment, not a substitute for sophisticated technical lobbying.</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:coalitions" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 2.2  </strong></span>Public pressure campaigns are organized by <em>coalitions</em> that include groups that engage in sophisticated technical lobbying.
</div>
<p>When policymaking pits broad public interests against narrower private interests, it is the public interest groups more often incentives to launch public pressure campaigns, both for policy and organizational reasons. Hypothesis <a href="whymail.html#hyp:public">2.3</a> posits a conditional logic in the
decision to mobilize. If resources drive outside lobbying,
business-driven coalitions should often dominate, as they do elsewhere.
However, I argue, because outside lobbying can alter the decision
environment, those who have the advantage in the usual rulemaking
process (where a more limited set of actors participate) have little
incentive to expand the scope of the conflict. Additionally, I argue, public interest groups have greater incentives than businesses to launch public pressure campaigns for reasons other than influencing policy.</p>
<!--2.3-->

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:public" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 2.3  </strong></span>Public interest group coalitions mobilize <em>more often</em> than private interest group (e.g., business-led) coalitions.
</div>
<p>Hypothesis <a href="whymail.html#hyp:public">2.3</a> may be evaluated in absolute terms–whether most public pressure campaigns are launched by public interest groups–or relative terms–whether public interest groups are more likely to lobby with the backing of a public pressure campaign than private interests.</p>
<p>The
converse could also be true. For example, business groups that are
already advantaged in the policy process may decide to leverage
their superior resources further to mobilize support to alter a bad
reputation or bolster claims that they represent more than their private
interest. If mobilization most often takes this “astroturf” form, this
would be evidence against
<a href="whymail.html#hyp:public">2.3</a> and Schattschneider’s argument that it is the
disadvantaged who seek to expand the scope of the conflict.</p>
<p>If the success of a mobilization effort is moderated
by latent public support, as my theory asserts, broader public interest group coalitions ought to
mobilize more people, more effort per person, and more people indirectly
for the same amount of mobilization effort (e.g., spending or
solicitations). That is, the scale and the intensity of public engagement depend on preexisting support for
the proposition that people are being asked to support.</p>
<!--2.4-->

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:public-success" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 2.4  </strong></span>Public interest group coalitions mobilize <em>more successfully</em> than private interest group (e.g., business-led) coalitions.
</div>
<p>Following the typology developed above, indicators of success include (1) the number
of comments supporting a coalition, (2) the effort per comment, and (3) the number of comments mobilized indirectly.</p>
<!--2.5-->
<p>Notwithstanding the incentive structure between coalitions advancing broad public interests and narrow private interests, resources and capacity are still necessary conditions to run a campaign. Most organizations that are
disadvantaged in the policy process also lack resources to launch
mass mobilization campaigns.</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:resources" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 2.5  </strong></span>Public pressure campaigns targeting national policy are most often run by large national policy advocacy organizations.
</div>
<!--2.6-->
<p>If private interest groups like businesses primarily use public pressure campaigns to counter a message of public consensus advanced by an opposing lobbying coalition, we should rarely see private interest groups lobbying unopposed. Hypothesis <a href="whymail.html#hyp:disrupt">2.6</a> would be supported by evidence that public interest group coalitions more often lobby unopposed than private interest groups.</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:disrupt" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 2.6  </strong></span>If narrow private interest groups (e.g., businesses) lunch public pressure campaigns, it is a response to an opposing campaign.

<!--
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:disrupt) would be undermined if lobbying organizations
with less public support are no more likely to engage in outside
lobbying when their opponents do so. 

While @Potter2017 found industry
groups were no more likely to advocate for rules to be strengthened,
weakened or withdrawn, this does not mean that they are not more likely
to mobilize when their opponents do so.

The key part of Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:support) is that mobilizing is correlated with
existing public support, what might be called "grass-roots" support. 

 It is possible
that the "potentially mobilized" segments of the public are unrelated to
public support before being contacted by the campaign, for example, if
mobilization is driven more by partisan identities than issue
preferences.

<!--If an organization does not perceive a
lobbying opportunity, it would be incorrect to call mobilization a
lobbying strategy. Many factors may contribute to perceived political
opportunities. For example, @Moore2017 finds that agencies that use high
levels of expertise (as defined by @Selin2015) receive fewer comments,
possibly because mobilizing organizations perceive these rules to be
less open to influence.-->

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Testing the Theory</h2>
<p>I focus on public comments in federal agency rulemaking, but the theories and methods here may also apply to other kinds of political engagement such as through social media or protests as well as to other political decisions, including state-level rulemaking.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<div id="why-data" class="section level3" number="2.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Data</h3>
<!--
Bring together information on the mass commenting coding in one table with statistics and examples to summarize for the reader.
-->
<p>To assess my hypotheses about the extent to which more powerful or less powerful groups mobilize public participation in bureaucratic policymaking, I collected a corpus of approximately 80 million comments via the
regulations.gov API. About 50 million of these comments were on proposed
rules (over 16,000 proposed rules from 144 agencies from 2005 to 2020). Of these, public pressure campaigns targeted approximately 400 rules from 46 agencies.
I then linked these comments to other data on the rules from the Unified
Agenda and Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs Reports on draft
rules sent to them for review. Summary statistics for these data are
available in the Appendix.</p>
<p>Importantly, even
campaigns that achieve very low public response rates appear in these
data. Because campaigns aim to collect thousands of comments, it is
implausible that even the most unpopular position would achieve no
supportive responses. For example, <span class="citation">Potter (<a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a><a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> found Poultry Producers
averaging only 319 comments per campaign. While this is far from the
Sierra Club’s average of 17,325 comments per campaign, it is also far
from zero.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="whymail.html#fig:comments-per-year">2.5</a> shows an exponential increase in the number of comments per rule over time. Note that comments per rule are on a
logarithmic scale on the y-axis. Proposed rules that have attracted the most public attention have
been published by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC,
omitted from this plot), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
the Department of Interior (DOI), the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management (BOEM), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB),
and Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).] Increasingly, a large number of people are
paying attention to agency policymaking.</p>

<p>Most public comments are, in fact, of the type suggested by the
solicitations on Regulations.gov—ordinary people voicing opinions on a proposed policy. They do not provide useful technical information or
suggest specific edits to policy texts like the interest group comments
that have thus far captured the attention of political scientists. If
they add information to rulemaking, it is a different, more political
flavor of information. Indeed as Figure
<a href="whymail.html#fig:comments-per-year">2.5</a> shows, every year since 2008, most people who
comment on draft regulations have done so as a result of a public pressure campaign.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Public engagement in rulemaking is highly

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Methods: Measuring Public Pressure and Political Information</h3>
<p>In section <a href="whymail.html#why-theory">2.2</a>, I argued that we should observe different patterns of public
participation depending on whether an organization launches a public pressure
campaign as an outside lobbying tactic (“going public”), as a reaction to such a campaign (“breaking a perceived consensus”), or
for reasons other than influencing policy (“credit claiming” or “going down fighting”). In this section, I develop methods to measure these patterns. These measures
capture similar statistics to questions posed by <span class="citation">Verba and Nie (<a href="#ref-Verba1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>, 9)</span>: “How
much participation is there, what kind is it, and from what segments of
society does it come?”</p>
<p>To identify the groups mobilizing public pressure campaigns, I develop methods to attribute individual comments to the
campaigns that mobilized them and to measure the intensity of preferences
expressed. To link individual comments to the more sophisticated
lobbying efforts they support, I first use textual similarity to identify
clusters of similar comments, reflecting formal and informal coalitions.
Comments with identical text (if any) indicate a coordinated campaign. Through an iterative process of hand-coding and computational methods, I then identify the organization responsible for mobilizing each comment and group organization into coalitions.</p>
<p>This approach is significantly different than that employed by previous studies in at least two ways. First, I identify coalitions consisting of multiple organizations. Previous studies measure campaigns at the organization level. For example, <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Balla2020"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> analyze “1,049 mass comment campaigns that occurred during 22 EPA rulemakings”—an average of nearly 50 “campaigns” per rule. By “campaign,” <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Balla2020"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> mean an organization’s campaign rather than a coalition’s campaign. Especially on EPA rules, there are rarely more than two or three coalitions engaging in public pressure campaigns–one of environmental advocacy groups and their allies, another of regulated industry groups and their allies. This is important because many comments that might be attributed to a small business, nonprofit, or membership organization are part of a campaign sponsored by a larger coalition of industry or public interest groups. It would be inappropriate to credit a small organization with little capacity for organizing a campaign when they merely allowed their mailing list to be used by a larger group. Using organizations as the unit of analysis may cause problems. If an analysis counts one coalition’s campaign as 40 smaller “campaigns” with the same policy demands and response, this one campaign would be counted as 40 non-independent observations. My methods allow me to measure levels of public pressure per organization and per coalition.</p>
<p>The second major difference between my approach and previous research is that I do not compare sophisticated comments to mass comments. Rather, I <em>attribute</em> mass comments to organizations and coalitions that also submit sophisticated technical comments. This difference is less important to the present analysis of the drivers of public pressure campaigns, but the set of comparisons one makes is critical to any study of responsiveness or policy influence. Researchers may reach different conclusions if they compare different things. Consider a study comparing agency responsiveness to Sierra Club form letters to agency responsiveness to the Sierra Club’s sophisticated comments. Now consider a study that compares responsiveness to the Sierra Club’s sophisticated comments across rules where they did and did not run a mass comment campaign. Likewise, a study comparing the average influence of form-letter comments to the average influence of sophisticated comments is very different from a study that compares the influence of two sets of sophisticated comments with different <em>levels</em> of public pressure behind them. By measuring comments per coalition, both through hand-coding and through text reuse, I capture different levels of public pressure than we would see if one were to look only at comments per organization.</p>
<p>For each campaign, I measure
the intensity and potential for the movement to grow. To measure
intensity, I examine the ratio of high-effort and low-effort comments.
To measure the potential to grow, I measure the number of comments mobilized
indirectly by the campaign (i.e., those that support a campaign but do
not include text provided by the campaign). The result is several new
measures of participation in bureaucratic policymaking.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> The observable implications of various forms of public engagement</h3>
<p>The different forms of participation asserted or assumed in the literature have empirically observable patterns.</p>
<div id="individuals" class="section level4" number="2.3.3.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3.1</span> Individuals</h4>
<p>The solicitation on regulations.gov–“Let your voice be heard”–suggests that individuals are expressing themselves directly. Indeed, anyone can write a letter or type a comment in the text box on regulations.gov, and many people do. Individuals acting on their own submit content ranging from obscenities and memes to detailed personal accounts of how a policy would affect them and even poetry aimed at changing officials’ hearts and minds.</p>
<p>Administrative law scholarship often discusses individual participants in this light as well.
<span class="citation">Cuéllar (<a href="#ref-Cuellar2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> finds that members of the “lay public” raise important new concerns beyond those raised by interest groups. He advocates for institutional reforms that would make it easier for individuals to participate and increase the sophistication of individual comments on proposed policies.</p>
<p>The remaining forms of participation are all mediated through an organization’s pressure campaign–what <span class="citation">Verba and Nie (<a href="#ref-Verba1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span> would call a “cooperative activity.” Comments from people mobilized as part of a campaign differ from those of individuals acting on their own in two observable ways: they often mention the name of the organization that mobilized them, and the text is often similar or identical to other comments in the campaign, reflecting coordination through form or template letters. These features eliminate the novel informational value that <span class="citation">Cuéllar (<a href="#ref-Cuellar2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> and others seek to locate in individual comments. If comments reference an organization that mobilized them, they likely have little to offer than that the more sophisticated organization has not already provided. If comments are identical, they certainly provide no new information.</p>
</div>
<div id="membership-organizations-1" class="section level4" number="2.3.3.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3.2</span> Membership Organizations</h4>
<p>If most commenters are members of membership organizations as <span class="citation">Kerwin and Furlong (<a href="#ref-Kerwin2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> suggest, a large campaign of, say one million people, will require a large collection of membership organizations. Very few organizations have a million members, and those that do are unlikely to mobilize all of them, so mobilizing a large number of people through membership organizations will usually require a large coalition of membership organizations. We would expect commenters to identify themselves as members of these many organizations.</p>
<p>For example, if most comments are mobilized by membership groups, we would expect most comments to look like this comment from the NorthEast Hook Fisherman’s Association:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We represent a small group of Commercial Fishermen with the Limited Access Handgear HA Permits, employing the use rod and reel, handlines or tub trawls to catch Cod, Haddock, and Pollock along with small quantities of other regulated and non-regulated marine fish. Historically and currently, our fishermen account for a small percentage of the groundfish landed in New England. However, the monetary gains obtained by the participants in this fishery are very important to us.” (<a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/NOAA-NMFS-2013-0050-0025">NOAA-NMFS-2013-0050-0025</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar groups, narrowly concerned about shrimp and halibut catch limits, also commented on this rule on behalf of their members.</p>

<div id="policy-change-organizations-from-grassroots-to-astroturf" class="section level4" number="2.3.3.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3.3</span> Policy Change Organizations: From Grassroots to Astroturf</h4>
<p>Mobilizing people just for a particular policy fight requires a significant organizing capacity. <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="McNutt2007"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> calls these formations “policy change organizations.” In contrast to membership organizations, they exist to organize public pressure toward a set of policy goals, not to serve a defined membership.</p>
<p>There is a spectrum of organizing the unorganized. The poles might be labeled “grassroots” and “astroturf.” On the grassroots end, engagement is driven by a combination of passionate volunteerism and a supportive, attentive public <span class="citation">(Key <a href="#ref-Key1961" role="doc-biblioref">1961</a>)</span> or issue public <span class="citation">(Converse <a href="#ref-Converse1964" role="doc-biblioref">1964</a>)</span>. In practice, the campaigns that most resemble the grassroots ideal are not pure volunteerism but are organized by policy change organizations like Credo Action and Organizing For American on the left and Americans for Prosperity on the right.
These organizations have large mailing lists and media operations. Membership organizations like the Sierra Club may often mobilize beyond their membership base and thus take the form of a policy change organization as well.
Like people mobilized through their membership organizations, people mobilized by policy change organizations will often cite the mobilizing organization.<br />
Unlike those mobilized through membership organizations, mobilization by policy change organizations is more likely to be concentrated in a few large organizations with the specific resources for running campaigns that engage passionate or interested but unaffiliated segments of the public.</p>
<p>Toward the astroturf end of the spectrum of policy change organizations, well-funded efforts gather signatures from a much less passionate and attentive population. Where grassroots organizing relies on existing underlying interests that merely need to be given an opportunity to engage, people engaged by astroturf campaigns are generally disinterested in the policy and engage merely because of paid ads or petition gathering, often involving some deception (e.g., intentionally misled about the policy or its likely effects) in order to get people to take action on an issue that they would not take if the issue was presented more clearly. Likewise, the organizations actually collecting the signatures would have no interest in doing so if they were not being paid. The aim is to give an appearance of support.
To the extent they mobilize real people, astroturf campaigns are thus a form of outside lobbying intended to create a deceptive appearance of public support. In the extreme, astroturf campaigns may use the names of fake or non-consenting individuals.</p>
<p>In a more complex example, Access Financial and other payday lending companies sponsored two campaigns targeting a regulation proposed by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2016. First, Access Financial had their employees solicit comments from customers, which Access then uploaded to regulations.gov. Many customer letters contained some version of “I have been told that payday loans would not exist in my community if the government’s proposed regulations went into effect.” The customer comments suggest that they had not been told much about the rule, which limited interest rates and the number of times short-term loans could be compounded. Most customers wrote some version of “Do not close this store”–a few even complained about exactly the issues that CFPB’s regulation aimed to address. One customer wrote, “Although some of the fees are a bit high, it should be my choice whether to get a loan or not” (Access Financial Comment 91130). Another wrote, “I need to keep receiving my Check’n’Go loans so I can have the time to start paying them back in the next 1 1/2 to 2 years” (Access Financial Comment 91130), indicating that Check’n’Go (a subsidiary of Access Financial) was engaged in serial re-lending that put this customer deeper in debt. To the extent that this campaign relied on deception and not the customer’s interests (even as the customers understood them), this would count as astroturf. Second, Access sponsored an effort to gather petition signatures at churches. Finally, Access and other payday loan companies uploaded supportive notes from community organizations to which they had given money. Like the churchgoers, these people had no reason to comment except that they had received money from the potentially regulated companies.</p>
<p>Spotting astroturf in the wild is difficult by design. However, the clear observable result is often a large number of comments advocating on behalf of large business interests. Large businesses or industry associations are the organizations with the resources and incentives to sponsor astroturf campaigns, and they do [Lyon2005].</p>
<p>Not all public pressure campaigns on behalf of private interests fall on the astroturf side of the spectrum. In a cover letter to a batch of comments opposing the regulation of glyphosate herbicides, Monsanto, major glyphosate manufacture, specified how they collected the letters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These letters were collected during the 2016 Farm Progress Show from US farmers, agriculture professionals, and general consumers who use glyphosate and value its benefits. We think it is important that these voices be heard as part of EPA’s review of glyphosate.” (<a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OPP-2009-0361-0891">EPA-HQ-OPP-2009-0361-0891</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shell Oil sponsored a campaign to open the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf to oil and gas drilling and provided a template letter with a place to insert a company or constituency:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“On behalf of [enter company or constituents], I am writing to demonstrate my strong support of oil and gas development in the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)…I support Shell’s plan to explore its leases in the Chukchi Sea in 2015. The company has invested significant time and resources in the advancement of safe and prudent Arctic exploration. Shell should be allowed to realize the promise of the leases it purchased, and I encourage the BOEM to expeditiously approve its Exploration Plan.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the signatories of this petition were mostly companies and workers in the oil and gas sector. Several elected officials also used Shell’s form letter (e.g. <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BSEE-2013-0011-0033">BSEE-2013-0011-0033</a> and <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BSEE-2013-0011-0094">BSEE-2013-0011-0094</a>). I found no evidence of deception or payments from Shell. These companies and workers presumably had a genuine interest in Shell’s access to offshore oil.</p>

Astroturf: Interest Group Lobbying and Corporate Strategy
Thomas P. Lyon  John W. Maxwell

- in which the firm covertly subsidizes a group with similar views to lobby when it normally would not;
Lloyd Bentsen, a long‐time senator from Texas, describes the artificial grassroots campaigns created by public relations (PR) firms (Stauber and Rampton, 1995, p. 79)
For example, Lupia and McCubbins (1994) and de Figueiredo et al. (1999) study how administrative procedures can be designed to optimize the flow of information to politicians, and Baron (2001) develops a model in which activists attempt to influence corporate strategy via the threat of consumer boycotts. Kollman (1998) studies the motivations and strategy behind lobbying behavior based on detailed interviews with 90 interest group leaders. Grossman and Helpman (2001) provide an excellent introduction to the recent theoretical literature on interest group politics.

Astroturf, quite simply, is synthetic grassroots organizing created for manipulative political purposes (see Lyon &
Maxwell, 2004; Allen, 1998; Austin, 2002). In this type of activity, an entity that wishes to affect public policy creates an effort
that gives the appearance of grassroots support

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.5</span> Who Lobbies Together?</h3>
<p>Having identified who is participating in rulemaking, the next step is
to determine who is lobbying together. Studies of rulemaking stress the importance of coalitions <span class="citation">(J. W. Yackee and Yackee <a href="#ref-Yackee2006JOP" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>; Dwidar <a href="#ref-Dwidar2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>. Scholars have measured coalitions of organized groups but have yet to attribute citizen comments to the coalition that mobilized them.</p>
<div id="identifying-coalitions-using-text-reuse" class="section level4" number="2.3.5.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.5.1</span> Identifying Coalitions Using Text Reuse</h4>
<p>I identify comments that are not identical but share a 10-word (or
“10-gram”) string using a moving window function looping over each
possible pair of texts to identify matches.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>
When actors sign onto the same comment, it is clear that they are
lobbying together. However, various businesses, advocacy groups, and
citizens often comment separately, even when they are aligned. Text-reuse (using the exact same ten-word phrases) captures this alignment.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="whymail.html#fig:percent-match">2.6</a> shows the percent of shared text for a sample of 50 comments on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s 2016 Rule regulating Payday Loans. Comments are arranged by the document identifier assigned by regulations.gov on both axes.
The black on the diagonal indicates that each document has perfect overlap with itself. Black squares off the diagonal indicate additional pairs of identical documents. For example, 100% of the words from Comment 95976 are part of some tengram that also appears in 95977 because the exact same comment was uploaded twice.
The block of grey squares indicates a coalition of commenters using some identical text.
Comments <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CFPB-2016-0025-91130">91130</a> through <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CFPB-2016-0025-91154">91156</a> are all partial or exact matches. Most are part of a mass comment campaign by Access Financial. The percent of the identical text is lower than many mass-comment campaigns because these are hand-written comments, but the n-gram method still picks up overlap in the OCRed text in the header and footer.</p>

<!--  Identifying coalitions using clustering methods
I use statistical models of text to classify comments into coalitions. I cluster
documents by the frequency with which they use different words. Being
classified together does not mean that the documents all address exactly
the same distribution of substantive issues, just that they use similar
words relative to the full set of documents. I start by modeling all
comments on each rule (collapsing identical comments to one document)
with two and three clusters, which I then inspect to see how well the
comments of named organizations were classified. If the two cluster
model most sensibly describes the conflict, I label these clusters "pro" and "con" If the three-cluster model more sensibly describes the
conflict, I label these clusters as "pro, con, other." If neither fits
well, I increase the number of clusters as needed.

"`{r kmeans, fig.cap = "K-means clustering fails to capture coalitions when nearly all comments oppose a regulation"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "kmeans.png"))
```


The asymmetry in expressed support for most rules presents challenges
for unsupervised clustering because much of the variation in comment
texts is within-coalition variation. For example, one of the most common
clustering methods, k-means clustering, often captures within-coalition
variation. Figure \@ref(fig:kmeans) shows k-means clusters based on a normalized
measure of word frequency (term-frequency/inverse-document-frequency)
compared to two principal components of variation. Neither k-means nor
principal components analysis is well suited to identifying the small
number of comments supporting the Park Service's proposed restrictions
on protests in Washington DC.

Two strategies may improve clustering. First, even partial text reuse
generally indicates that comments belong to the same coalition. For
example, as seen at the top of Figure
\@ref(fig:kmeans), models may be restricted to cluster the large number of comments beginning with
"As a citizen who has frequently participated" in the same coalition
even if they go on to add different personal anecdotes about why protest
rights are important to them. Thus, clustering methods could be
restricted to group partially copied texts, as well as entirely copied
texts. Second, a Bayesian mixture model may better recover pro and con
clusters, especially with strong priors comments using positive and
negative sentiment words belong together.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.6</span> Measuring the Volume, Intensity, and Potential Contagion of Public Engagement</h3>
<p>I measure variation in engagement in three ways, corresponding to the
three types of comments described above.</p>
<p><strong>Volume.</strong>
First, I measure the total number of comments on the rule.
Commenting results from multiple processes. First, a group must decide to
lobby. Then, a group must decide to mobilize public pressure. Finally, the resulting number of comments depends on the response to the
campaign. There may be many cases where groups may have had
success mobilizing but never reached the choice of whether to mobilize
or not. For example, relevant groups may have been unaware of the draft rule. Once the decision
to mobilize has been reached and made, the response to mobilizing is a
count process. Thus, I expect the count of comments across rules to
follow a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Effort.</strong>
I measure effort per comment by the number of words people
write, omitting any text longer than ten words not unique to that comment,
usually because a mobilizing organization provided it. For example, the Sierra Club mobilized more than 47,710
people to submit exactly the same text on the delay of the methane
pollution rule, but 7,452 people also took the time to write a
personalized comment in addition to the text provided (see Figure <a href="whymail.html#fig:sierra">2.4</a>).
Completely unique comments (those that do not copy text from a form letter at all) generally indicated high levels of effort. As <span class="citation">Verba and Nie (<a href="#ref-Verba1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span> note, signing a form letter requires “some” effort, writing an original letter to a government official requires “a lot” of “initiative” (effort). The longer the letter, the more effort required.</p>
<p>While effort, as measured by the number of words people write, maybe normally distributed, the low end of the observed distribution is truncated.
This is because we will not observe people who have low levels of passion for the issue; they either do not cross the effort threshold required to comment or opt
to write nothing more than the form letter.</p>
<p><strong>Contagion.</strong> Mass-comment campaigns have wildly different results.
Some organizations submit a clean 10,000 copies of (signatures on) the same comment.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>
Others “go viral”—inspiring a mess of further engagement where the
original messages are translated through social media posts and news
stories. To identify people who were plausibly mobilized indirectly by a
campaign, I count the number of people who use a similar distribution of
words to that of the form letter but fewer than ten words matching any
other comment. This is a regular count process.</p>

another comment on the same rule or not. I call comments that have between 2 and 99
identical copies, “medium batch” because such comments may reflect
coordinated efforts among interest groups that do not include a public
pressure strategy that involves mobilizing ordinary people. Even relatively unsuccessful public pressure campaigns yield far more than 99 comments. “Mass comments” are comments with 100 or more identical copies or comments that were uploaded in bulk batches of at least 100. These were almost certainly mobilized by a public pressure campaign. Figure <a href="whymail.html#fig:comments-mass">2.9</a> shows that public pressure campaigns mobilize the vast majority of comments.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.4.1</span> A coalition of public-interest organizations mobilize most comments.</h4>
<p>As Figure <a href="whymail.html#fig:topdockets">2.12</a> shows, the most prolific mobilizers are
environmental groups. On five out of the top ten dockets (here including
rulemaking and non-rulemaking dockets), a similar coalition of groups
mobilized most public comments. In part, this is because the
Environmental Protection Agency produces a large share of the
substantive rules posted to regulations.gov. However, it is notable
that 19 of the top 20 mobilizers generally
lobby together on the top ten dockets. America’s Energy Cooperatives (AEC), an industry association,
stands out as the lone mobilizer on behalf of its
members’ material interest. Notably, it only mobilized significantly on the Clean Power
Plan but not on the subsequent Clean Power Plan repeal. If public
interest group mobilizing on the Clean Power Plan was an example of
“going public” to pressure the Obama administration and then “going
down fighting” in the face of the Trump administration’s repeal,
industry counter-mobilization responding to the first, but not the
second aligns with (ref:disrupt). If AEC found their policy goals in the Clean Power Plan rulemaking threatened by the political information being generated by environmental groups, it would make sense to devote resources to their own public pressure campaign to disrupt any perceived consensus. Likewise, if AEC was not concerned that environmental group mobilizing would affect the Clean Power Plan repeal, sponsoring a public pressure campaign would be a poor investment.</p>

<li id="fn5"><p>Some of the most contentious recent public controversies involve bureaucratic policymaking. For example, along with 50 thousand
protesters in Washington D.C., the State Department Received 1.2
million comments on the Environmental Impact Statement for the
Keystone Pipeline. Similarly, along with the thousands of protesters
supporting the Standing Rock Sioux protest to the Dakota Access
Pipeline, the Army Corps of Engineers received hundreds of thousands of comments. Alongside protest actions that included shutting down many websites, the Federal Communications Commission’s open internet rule received 22 million comments. While some of these comments appear fake, the scale of public engagement is remarkable given how little attention political scientists have paid to it.
Fake public comments also raise the question of why an organization
would bother to generate fake public input if it did not matter, as
its omission from theories of bureaucratic policymaking would seem

However, some argue that
participation only counts if it is deliberative, which mass comment campaigns are not, at least not at the individual level.<!--@Goodin2006-->
Other criteria posed by normative theorists that participation should be “genuine,” “informed,” or “reasoned” are more difficult to assess. Normative theorists debate whether deliberation among a small number of people is preferable to a large number of people simply expressing their preferences. But empirically, public participation in bureaucratic policymaking is much more the latter <span class="citation">(Shapiro <a href="#ref-Shapiro2008b" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>.<a href="whymail.html#fnref8" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
