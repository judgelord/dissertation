<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>I examine who participates in public pressure campaigns and why. Scholars of bureaucratic policymaking have focused on the sophisticated lobbying efforts of powerful interest groups. Yet agencies occasionally receive thousands or even millions of comments from ordinary people. How, if at all, should scholars incorporate mass participation into models of bureaucratic policymaking? Are public pressure campaigns, like other lobbying tactics, primarily used by well-resourced groups to create an impression of public support? Or are they better understood as conflict expansion tactics used by less-resourced groups? To answer these questions, I collect and analyze millions of public comments on draft agency rules. Using text analysis methods underlying plagiarism detection, I match individual public comments to pressure-group campaigns. Contrary to other forms of lobbying, I find that mass comment campaigns are almost always a conflict expansion tactic rather than well-resourced groups creating an impression of public support. Most public comments are mobilized by public interest organizations, not “astroturf” campaigns. Over 80% of the 48 million comments on proposed rules posted to regulations.gov were mobilized by just 100 organizations, 87 of which lobby in coalitions with each other. Contrary to other forms of political participation, I find no evidence of negativity bias in public comments. Indeed, from 2,005 to 2,017, most comments supported proposed rules. This is because public comments tend to support Democratic policies and oppose Republican policies, reflecting the asymmetry in mobilizing groups</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Participatory processes like public comment periods, where government
agencies must solicit public input on draft policies, are said to provide democratic legitimacy <span class="citation">(Croley <a href="#ref-Croley2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Rosenbloom <a href="#ref-Rosenbloom2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>, political oversight opportunities <span class="citation">(Balla <a href="#ref-Balla1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>; Mccubbins and Schwartz <a href="#ref-Mccubbins1984" role="doc-biblioref">1984</a>)</span>, and new technical information <span class="citation">(S. W. Yackee <a href="#ref-Yackee2006JPART" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>; Nelson and Yackee <a href="#ref-Nelson2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In civics classrooms and Norman Rockwell paintings, raising concerns to government is an individual affair. Scholars, too, often focus on studying and improving the ability of individuals to participate in policymaking <span class="citation">(Cuéllar <a href="#ref-Cuellar2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>. But in practice, the capacities required to lobby effectively on matters of national policy are those of organized groups, not individual voters.</p>
<!--PUZZLE-->
<p>Bureaucratic policymaking, in particular, is the ideal context for powerful organized interests to dominate. Policies made by specialized agencies are likely to have concentrated benefits or costs that lead interest groups, especially businesses, to dominate <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Lowi"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. Organizations with superior resources use them to flood policymakers with technical information <span class="citation">(Wagner <a href="#ref-Wagner2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>And yet, activists frequently target agency policymaking with letter-writing campaigns, petitions, protests,
and mobilizing people to attend hearings, all classic examples of “civic engagement” <span class="citation">(Verba and Nie <a href="#ref-Verba1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span>. While recent scholarship on agency policymaking has shed light on sophisticated lobbying, especially by businesses, we know surprisingly little about the vast majority of public comments, which are submitted by ordinary people as part of public pressure campaigns.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>While practitioners and administrative law scholars have long pondered
what to make of letter-writing campaigns targeting the bureaucracy, political scientists have had
surprisingly little to say about this kind of civic participation and the role of public pressure in bureaucratic policymaking. Much of our knowledge about civic participation beyond voting comes from surveys <span class="citation">(e.g. Verba and Nie <a href="#ref-Verba1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span> and qualitative studies of particular groups.
Models of bureaucratic policymaking focus on the participation of sophisticated lobbying groups and neither explain nor account for public pressure campaigns.
Civic engagement and organized public pressure thus remain poorly understood in the context of bureaucratic policymaking. To fill this gap, I bring scholarship on policy advocacy groups<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> into conversation with theories of bureaucratic policymaking. Doing so reveals competing intuitions about the drivers of public participation, which I then assess using a large new dataset of participation in federal agency rulemaking.</p>
<p>To begin to make sense of public participation in bureaucratic policymaking, I develop a typology of different kinds of participation, with implications for the normative value of participatory institutions. Because political participation is often a collective affair, this includes a typology of public pressure campaigns.
I argue that the extent to which public comment periods serve the functions and provide the normative benefits that proponents assert depends on who participates. To the extent that public pressure campaigns drive participation, the normative value of participatory processes like public comment periods depends on who organizes these campaigns.</p>
<p>Suppose public pressure campaigns follow the usual patterns of interest group lobbying, where the groups with the most resources dominate. In that case, the procedural legitimacy they provide is merely a veneer masking the influence of powerful political insiders. Instead of encouraging political oversight, they would discourage it. Instead of diversifying the available information, they would merely reinforce the claims and issue frames of powerful insiders. We would expect a pressure campaign to push policy further in the direction desired by powerful insiders.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the usual suspects do not dominate public pressure campaigns, they may yet improve the democratic credentials of American policymaking, expand political oversight, and diversify the information available to policymakers. To the extent that the possibility of public pressure tactics empowers groups that are usually left out of the policy process, pressure campaigns may blunt the influence of powerful insiders.</p>
<p>Thus, to understand the empirical effects or normative value of participatory processes like public comment periods, we first need to know who participates and why. Specifically, we need to know who is behind public pressure campaigns.</p>
<p>I develop and assess two competing theories of who should mobilize public pressure campaigns and why. Each theory has observable implications for which types of groups will run campaigns in different contexts. One stems from leading theories of bureaucratic decision-making and interest group lobbying. It predicts that groups with more resources will dominate all forms of lobbying, including public pressure campaigns. The other emerges from democratic theories. It predicts that pressure campaigns will generally be used by groups with fewer material resources but more popular support. <!--Schattschneider1975 Kollman1998--></p>
<p>To assess these theories, I assemble a new dataset of over 500 public pressure campaigns that collectively mobilized approximately 50 million people across three administrations from 2005 to 2020. Using a mix of qualitative hand-coding and computational text analysis, I identify the coalitions of groups behind each campaign and the type of interest they represent.</p>

<p>The contentious politics that inspire most public engagement in policymaking have no place in leading models of bureaucratic policymaking and have largely been ignored by political scientists.
Foundational scholarship on rulemaking <span class="citation">(Furlong and Kerwin <a href="#ref-Furlong2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>, @Furlong1997, @Furlong1998, @Kerwin2011)</span> focuses on interest group lobbying.

<!--Most scholars are skeptical that public pressure can affect rulemaking.-->
<p>To the extent that scholars address the input of ordinary people at all, both
existing theory and empirical scholarship suggest skepticism that non-sophisticated actors matter. (By “ordinary” people, I simply mean people who are not
professional policy influencers.)
Empirical scholarship finds that economic elites and business groups
dominate American politics in general <span class="citation">(Jacobs and Skocpol <a href="#ref-Jacobs2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>, @Soss2007, Hertel–Fernandez2019, @Hacker2003, @Gilens2014)</span> and rulemaking in
particular. While some are optimistic that requirements for agencies to
solicit and respond to public comments on proposed rules allow “civil
society” to provide public oversight <span class="citation">(Michaels <a href="#ref-Michaels2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>; Metzger <a href="#ref-Metzger2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>, most
studies find that participants in rulemaking often represent elites and
business interests <span class="citation">(Seifter <a href="#ref-Seifter2016UCLA" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>; Crow, Albright, and Koebele <a href="#ref-Crow2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>; Wagner, Barnes, and Peters <a href="#ref-Wagner2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>; West <a href="#ref-West2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>; J.

<!--
From a strategic perspective, agency officials are not directly
accountable to voters. And even if organized groups do supplement
congressional and judicial checks on executive power, the groups that
participate in rulemaking represent only certain (if any) segments of
the public and may not represent them well [@Seifter2016UCLA].--></p>
<p>Because scholars are skeptical about rulemaking as a venue for collective action, most dismiss public pressure campaigns as epiphenomenal to bargaining with political principals
or interest groups. Indeed, almost all empirical studies of rulemaking
discard unsophisticated comments from ordinary people, as evident from a
comprehensive review of scholarship on “The Politics of Rulemaking” by
<span class="citation">Yackee (<a href="#ref-Yackee2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, who finds skepticism about citizen comments, but no studies
analyzing public pressure campaigns as a lobbying tactic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<span class="citation">Kerwin and Furlong (<a href="#ref-Kerwin2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> point out that a citizen must know not only that a regulation is being formulated but also how and when to participate. This is a high bar for most Americans. Second, to be influential during rulemaking, commenters may require resources and technical expertise. As <span class="citation">Epstein, Heidt, and Farina (<a href="#ref-Epstein2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> suggest, agency rule-writers—who are often chosen because of their technical or policy-specific expertise—privilege the type of data-driven arguments and reasoning
that are not common to citizen comments.” (p. 10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For any particular lay commenter, this conclusion seems inescapable; individuals acting alone are unlikely to affect policy. As Hacker and Pierson (Forthcoming) observe,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[The United States’] institutional terrain advantages political actors with the capacity to work across multiple venues, over extended periods, and in a political environment where coordinated government action is difficult, and strategies of evasion and exit from regulatory constraints are often successful. These capacities are characteristic of organized groups, not individual voters.”</p>
</blockquote>
<!--PUSZZEL (AGAIN?) -->
<p>But groups occasionally mobilize a large number of people, usually behind a more sophisticated lobbying effort. Without a systematic understanding of the scale and impact of public participation–<em>group-mediated</em> participation–in rulemaking, it is impossible to answer normative questions about how participatory processes like public comment periods may enhance or undermine various democratic ideals.
<!--These bursts of civic participation may affect
rulemaking [@Coglianese2001], but **this intuition has yet to be tested.**--></p>
<p>Scholars’ neglect of public pressure campaigns is surprising given that most people are only
aware of agency rulemaking when it is the target of a high-profile mass
mobilization campaign.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> While most rules receive little attention,
the ease of online mobilizing and commenting has, like other forms of

<p>The general failure to explain or account for public pressure campaigns in models of bureaucratic policymaking is also striking in light of how agencies advertise public
comment periods as an opportunity for a voice in government

<p>While “ordinary” members of the public may occasionally provide novel
and useful technical information to expert bureaucrats, such
sophisticated means of influencing policy are out of reach for the vast
majority of people. Thus, to investigate the potential role of ordinary
people in bureaucratic politics I look elsewhere—not because ordinary
people never provide novel and useful technical information, but because
this is not how most people attempt to influence policy, nor, I argue,
how we should expect ordinary people to have influence.</p>
<p>Most public comments are, in fact, of the type suggested by the
solicitations on Regulations.gov—ordinary people voicing opinions on a proposed policy. They do not provide useful technical information or
suggest specific edits to policy texts like the interest group comments
that have thus far captured the attention of political scientists. If
they add information to rulemaking, it is a different, more political
flavor of information. Indeed as Figure
<a href="whymail.html#fig:comments-per-year">2.5</a> shows, every year since 2008, most people who
comment on draft regulations have done so as a result of a public pressure campaign.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Public engagement in rulemaking is highly
clustered on a few rules made salient by these campaigns. It is
plausible that at least some of the time, such campaigns aim to
influence policy. It is also plausible that thousands of people engaging
may alter the politics of these policy processes, but this hypothesis
remains untested. Indeed, we have much to understand about the causes
and effects of these campaigns before we are in a position to ask if
they are a mechanism for groups to influence policy. Most critically, we
must understand who mobilizes and why.</p>
<!--/now in influence 01-->
<p>The kind of politics created by mass engagement has a few notable
features. It is contentious; most ordinary people are not engaging in
deliberation; they are simply making demands. Importantly, however,
processes like public comment periods channel contentious demands into
institutionalized policy processes rather than undermining them. In
short, the politics of rulemaking created by public pressure campaigns is much
more contentious than most rulemakings but also much more
institutionalized than most contentious politics. Mass engagement in
rulemaking thus presents a novel context to examine the consequences of
broader public participation in typically insider-dominated policymaking and how
public pressure may condition how political decisions are made.</p>
<p>Public pressure campaigns expand civic participation in policymaking.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>
Surely, those who engage are far from representative of the broader public <span class="citation">(Verba and Nie <a href="#ref-Verba1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span>, but in many ways, they must be more representative than the handful of political insiders who participate in most policy processes.</p>
<p>If the usual participants have “an upper-class accent” <span class="citation">(Schattschneider <a href="#ref-Schattschneider1942" role="doc-biblioref">1942</a>)</span>, does adding thousands of more voices dilute this bias? I argue that the answer depends on how people are mobilized. If public pressure is mobilized by the usual participants to create an impression of public support, it may merely legitimize the demands of powerful interest groups.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.5</span> Incorporating political information into models of lobbying in rulemaking</h3>
<!--% MAIN QUESTION 
### Incorporating mass engagement into theories of bureaucratic policymaking.-->
<p>How, if at all, should scholars incorporate mass engagement into models of bureaucratic policymaking?</p>
<p>I argue that mass engagement produces potentially valuable political information about the coalition that mobilized it. Political information may play two distinct roles with opposite effects depending on who mobilized it. The normative and empirical import of public pressure campaigns thus turns on who is behind them.</p>
<p>To the extent that well-resourced groups use public pressure campaigns to create a misleading impression of public support (often called “astroturf”), their role is to strengthen and legitimize demands of the same powerful interests that dominate bureaucratic policymaking <span class="citation">(J. W. Yackee and Yackee <a href="#ref-Yackee2006JOP" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>. Here, just as groups with superior resources use them to flood policymakers with technical information <span class="citation">(Wagner <a href="#ref-Wagner2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>, astroturf campaigns convert economic resources into political information in the form of an impression of public support generated by signatures or form letters. Even groups with few members or a narrow or non-existent base of support among the public may create the appearance of public support by sponsoring pressure campaigns. If the powerful business groups that dominate other forms of lobbying also dominate public pressure campaigns, these campaigns (and perhaps public comment periods themselves) are normatively suspect, merely providing a democratic veneer to economic power. Empirically, we would thus expect public pressure campaigns to further advantage well-resourced interests.</p>
<p>Alternatively, to the extent that public interest groups use public pressure campaigns are used as conflict expansion tactics by less-resourced groups, their role is the opposite: to push back against powerful interests that dominate bureaucratic policymaking. The political information created by conflict expansion can reveal existing and potential support among attentive segments of the public. Through public pressure campaigns, groups that lack financial resources can convert latent public support into concrete political information that may cause policymakers to update their beliefs and change their behavior.<br />
If mass commenting is mainly a vehicle for public interest groups to convert a latent base of public support into influential political information supporting their representational claims, public comment periods may yet serve some of informing, balancing, and democratic functions that practitioners and normative theorists hoped they would. Empirically, we would then expect public pressure campaigns to disadvantage well-resourced interests that dominate most policy processes.</p>

The next section builds a causal theory. I theorize that activists' opportunities and strategies and latent public opinion drive engagement.

% The following section outlines methodologies to assess my three overarching questions and their component parts. These methods rely on analysis of comment and policy texts as large-n observational data. -->
<p>This section offers a theory and hypotheses to explain variation in mass
engagement. I argue that we should observe different patterns of
engagement depending on whether an organization launches a mobilization
campaign as an outside lobbying tactic, to counter such a campaign, or
for reasons other than influencing policy. In the next section, I
develop methods to measure these patterns. In short, these measures
capture similar statistics to questions posed by <span class="citation">Verba and Nie (<a href="#ref-Verba1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>, 9)</span>: “How
much participation is there, what kind is it, and from what segments of
society does it come?”</p>
<p>As noted above, scholars of bureaucratic policymaking have focused on
the sophisticated lobbying efforts of powerful interest groups such as
business coalitions. A key insight from this scholarship is that
technical information is the currency of insider lobbying. Figure
<a href="whymail.html#fig:causal-classic">2.2</a> illustrates the classic causal
model of insider lobbying that describes most rulemakings and nearly all
scholarship on lobbying in bureaucratic policymaking to date.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>
However, mass engagement has no place in this model. I aim to fill this
gap.</p>

<p>Here I build on three insights. First, <span class="citation">Furlong (<a href="#ref-Furlong1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Kerwin and Furlong (<a href="#ref-Kerwin2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>
identify mobilization as a tactic. The organizations that they surveyed
reported that forming coalitions and mobilizing large numbers of people
are among the most effective lobbying tactics. Second, <span class="citation">Nelson and Yackee (<a href="#ref-Nelson2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>
identify political information as a potentially influential result of
lobbying by different business coalitions. While they focus on
mobilizing experts, I argue that <span class="citation">Nelson and Yackee (<a href="#ref-Nelson2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> describe a dynamic that can be extended
to public pressure campaigns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“strategic recruitment, we theorize, mobilizes new actors to participate in the policymaking process, bringing with them novel technical and political information. In other words, when an expanded strategy is employed, leaders activate individuals and organizations to participate in the policymaking process who, without the coordinating efforts of the leaders, would otherwise not lobby. This activation is important because it implies that coalition lobbying can generate new information and new actors—beyond simply the ‘usual suspects’—relevant to policy decisionmakers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concerning political information, this logic extends to
non-experts. The number and distribution of ordinary supporters may
matter because it suggests a <em>public</em> consensus. Instead of bolstering
<em>scientific</em> claims, a perceived public consensus bolsters <em>political</em>
claims. To understand how groups
lobby in rulemaking, we must understand mass mobilization as a tactic
aimed at producing political information.</p>
<p>While most scholars have emphasized the lack of useful technical information in mass comments, a few have raised their role in creating
political information. <span class="citation">Cuéllar (<a href="#ref-Cuellar2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> calls on agencies to pay more
attention to ordinary peoples’ expressions of preference and <span class="citation">Rauch (<a href="#ref-Rauch2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>
suggests that agencies reform the public comment process to include
opinion polls.</p>
<p>I build from a similar intuition that public pressure
campaigns currently function like a poll or, more accurately, a petition, capturing the intensity of preferences among the attentive
public—i.e., how many people are willing to take the time to
engage. For example, a campaign by the World Wildlife Federation provided
language explicitly claiming to have public opinion on their side.
Their model comment cited an opinion poll, stating that “Along with 80% of the American
people, I strongly support ending commercial trade in elephant ivory
in the U.S.” This suggests that mass comment campaigns aim to signal
information about public opinion.</p>
<p>Self-selection may not be ideal for representation, but
opt-in participation—whether voting, attending a hearing, or writing a
comment—may often be one of the few heuristics decisionmakers have
about public preferences.</p>
<p>Mobilizing citizens and generating new political information are key functions of interest groups in a democracy
<span class="citation">(Mansbridge <a href="#ref-Mansbridge1992" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>; Mahoney <a href="#ref-Mahoney2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a><a href="#ref-Mahoney2007" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span>. Petitioning, in particular, is a mechanism of raising “new claims” <span class="citation">(Carpenter, <a href="#ref-CarpenterPetitions" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a>)</span>. Campaigns inform agencies about the
distribution and intensity of opinions that are often too nuanced to
estimate a priori. Many questions that arise in rulemaking lack
analogous public opinion polling questions, making mass commenting a
unique source of political information. As with public opinion on any
specific policy issues, most members of the public and their elected
representatives may only learn about the issue and take a position as a
result of a public pressure campaign <span class="citation">(Hutchings <a href="#ref-Hutchings2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>. I thus consider
public demands to be a latent factor in my model of policymaking (Figure
<a href="whymail.html#fig:causal-whymail">2.3</a>. Public demands shape the decisions of
groups who lobby in rulemaking. If they believe the attentive public is
on their side, groups may attempt to reveal this political information
to policymakers by launching a mass mobilization campaign. The public
response to the campaign depends on the extent that the attentive public
is passionate about the issue.</p>

group lobbying (Figure <a href="whymail.html#fig:causal-classic">2.2</a>) to incorporate political information about the attentive public. In addition to providing technical information through sophisticated comments, an organization may mobilize supporters.
The more latent public support a group has, the more successful this mobilization effort will be. Because lobbying organizations likely have some idea of the level of public support for their positions, the observable implication of this is that groups will choose to mobilize either when they have a good deal of public support (where public support is a resource) or the resources to compensate for a tepid response to their campaign (in the case of astroturf campaigns).
Large-scale engagement may produce several types of relevant political
information. The most direct and obvious is the expressed “public
opinion” that policymakers observe.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The causal process visualized in Figure
<a href="whymail.html#fig:causal-whymail">2.3</a> may only operate under certain conditions.

<div id="types-of-pressure-campaign-motivations" class="section level3" number="2.2.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.6</span> Types of Pressure Campaign Motivations</h3>
<p>The effects of public pressure campaigns depend, in part, on the aims of a
campaign. I distinguish campaigns by which of four distinct aims
they pursue: (1) to win concessions by <em>going public</em>, (2) to <em>disrupt a perceived consensus</em>, or (3) to satisfy some audience other than policymakers by <em>going down fighting</em> or (4) to satisfy some audience other than policymakers by <em>credit claiming</em>. Going public and disrupting a perceived consensus are, respectively, forms of proactive and reactive outside lobbying. Going down fighting and credit claiming to describe
situations where the organization does not expect to influence policy but
mobilizes for other reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Going public.</strong> Coalitions “go public” when they believe that
expanding the scope of conflict gives them an advantage.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> As these
are the coalitions that believe they have more intense public
support, mass engagement is likely to skew heavily toward this side.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>
Indeed, <span class="citation">Potter (<a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a><a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> finds that advocacy group-driven campaigns mobilize
far more people on average than industry-driven campaigns. Additionally,
many people may be inspired indirectly (e.g., through news stories) or
to engage with more effort (e.g., writing longer comments) than people
mobilized by the side with less public support. This is important
because political information may be especially influential if
decisionmakers perceive a consensus.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Disrupting a perceived consensus.</strong> I theorize that when coalitions
with less public support mobilize, it is a reaction to their opponents.
Because the impression of consensus is powerful, when a coalition goes
public, an opposing coalition may countermobilize. Because I theorize
that these are coalitions with less intense public support and its aim
is prevent a perceived consensus, I expect such campaigns to engage
fewer people, less effort per person, and yield a smaller portion of
indirect engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Going down fighting.</strong> Finally, campaigns may target supporters rather
than policymakers. Sometimes organizations “go down fighting” to fulfill
supporters’ expectations. For example, <span class="citation">Carpenter et al. (<a href="#ref-Carpenter2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> finds that anti-slavery petitions were this type of campaign where “the most important readers of a
petition are its signatories.” In the context of notice and comment rulemaking, after a draft policy is published, failing to secure one’s demands is always a loss, so I use “going down fighting” as shorthand for
campaigns aimed primarily at fulfilling member, donor, or supporter
expectations and related logics that are internal to the organization,
including member retention or recruitment (<span class="citation">Carpenter and Moore (<a href="#ref-Carpenter2014b" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Carpenter et al. (<a href="#ref-Carpenter2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>), fundraising, or satisfying a
board of directors. For example, as Figure <a href="whymail.html#fig:sierra">2.4</a> shows, the Sierra Club uses campaigns to collect
contact information of supporters and potential members. In this case,
given the executive-branch transition between 2010 when the rule was
initiated and 2017 when it was delayed, the Sierra Club may have had
little hope of protecting methane pollution standards, but for members
of the public who wanted to voice their opinion, the Sierra Club created
an easy way to do so, as long as users consented to “receive periodic
communication from the Sierra Club.”</p>

<p class="caption">

</div>
<p>While such campaigns may engage many people, they are unlikely to affect
policy or to inspire countermobilization. I expect such campaigns to
occur on rules that have high partisan salience (e.g., rules following
major legislation passed on a narrow vote), rules that propose large
shifts on policy issues dear to member-funded public interest groups, or
rulemaking started shortly after presidential transitions when
executive-branch agendas shift more quickly than public opinion.</p>
<p>When a lobbying coalition with more intense public support successfully
mobilizes for reasons other than influencing policy, opposing coalitions
with less public support are not more likely to countermobilize.</p>
<p>Going public and going down fighting may be difficult to distinguish in
the observed public response. Indeed, members of the public may poorly
understand the different chances of success in each case. However,
lobbying organization do likely know their chances of success and should
thus invest less in sophisticated insider lobbying under the going down
fighting strategy. By identify cases where coalitions engage in large
public campaigns without corresponding investment in sophisticated
lobbying, I can assess whether countermobilization and is indeed less
likely in these cases. Table
<a href="whymail.html#tab:campaigns-patterns">2.1</a> specifies the general pattern of
engagement suggested by each of the three reasons behind mass-comment
campaigns.</p>

<p>As Table <a href="whymail.html#tab:campaigns-patterns">2.1</a> suggests, the relevant statistic
distinguishing patterns is the <em>relative</em> number of each type of comment
on each side on a given rulemaking docket. Even among rules targeted by
campaigns, salience varies significantly, and thus “high” and “low” numbers of comments will differ across rules. Importantly, even
campaigns that achieve very low public response rates appear in these
data. Because campaigns aim to collect thousands of comments, it is
implausible that even the most unpopular position would achieve no
supportive responses. For example, <span class="citation">Potter (<a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a><a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> found Poultry Producers
averaging only 319 comments per campaign. While this is far from the
Sierra Club’s average of 17,325 comments per campaign, it is also far
from zero.</p>
<div id="public-and-private-aims" class="section level4" number="2.2.6.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.6.1</span> Public and private aims</h4>
<p>Public pressure campaigns claim to represent and evoke the public interest. For example, the Oceana coalition framed its mass mobilization effort to curb the
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s 2017 Proposed Offshore Oil and Gas
Leasing Program as a “petition signed by 67,275 self-proclaimed United
States residents,” suggesting that organizations consider these efforts
as akin to petitions. In the same statement, Oceana also claimed the
support of “more than 110 East Coast municipalities, 100 Members of
Congress, 750 state and local elected officials, and 1,100 business
interests, all of whom oppose offshore drilling,” suggesting that claims
of public and elected official support aim to provide similar kinds of
political information.</p>
<p>Appeals to the government are almost always couched in the language of
public interest, even when true motivations are private
<span class="citation">(Schattschneider <a href="#ref-Schattschneider1975" role="doc-biblioref">1975</a>)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: MORE ABOUT PUBLIC VS PRIVATE COALITIONS TO SET UP HYPOTHESES. ESP. ADD MORE ABOUT PRIVATE COALITIONS’ RESOURCES</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While coalitions may form around various material and ideological
conflicts, those most likely to be advantaged by going public or going
down fighting are public interest groups—organizations primarily
serving an idea of the public good rather than the material interests of
their members.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Thus, I theorize that mass mobilization is most
likely to occur in conflicts of public versus private interests or
public versus public interests (i.e., between coalitions led by groups
with distinct cultural ideals or desired public goods), provided they
have sufficient resources to run a campaign. If true, one implication is
that mass mobilization will systematically run counter to concentrated
business interests where they conflict with the values of public
interest groups with sufficient resources to mobilize.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="types-of-public-engagement" class="section level3" number="2.2.7">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.7</span> Types of Public Engagement</h3>
<p>I classify supporters into three types that help describe key pieces of
political information. I illustrate these types in the context of public
comments. Comments that are exact copies of a form letter are akin to
petition signatures from supporters who were engaged by a campaign to
comment with minimal effort. Commenters that also take time to add text
indicate more intense preferences. Finally, commenters who express
solidarity in similar but distinct phrases indicate they were engaged
indirectly, perhaps by a news story or a social media post about the campaign, as campaign messages spread beyond those initially
targeted.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Because the success of a mobilization effort is moderated
by public support, broader public interest group coalitions ought to
mobilize more people, more effort per person, and more people indirectly
for the same amount of mobilization effort (e.g., spending or
solicitations).</p>
<p>Public interest group coalitions mobilize more successfully than
business-driven coalitions. Indicators of success include (1) the number
of comments supporting a coalition, (2) the effort per comment, and (3) the
number of comments mobilized indirectly.</p>
<p>The size of each group thus offers political information to
policymakers, including coalition resources, the intensity of sentiment,
and the potential for conflict to spread. The first two types signal two
kinds of intensity or resolve. First, they show the mobilizers’
willingness to commit resources to the issue. Second, costly actions
show the intensity of opinions among the mobilized segment of the public
<span class="citation">(Dunleavy <a href="#ref-Dunleavy1991" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a>)</span>. The number of people engaged by a campaign is not
strictly proportional to an organization’s investment. The less people
care, the more it costs to mobilize them. The third type indicates
potential contagion. Indications that messages spread beyond those
initially targeted may be especially powerful <span class="citation">(Kollman <a href="#ref-Kollman1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Information about organizational resolve, the intensity of public demands, and contagiousness are thus produced, but such political
information will only influence decisions if these signals are processed
in a way that captures this information and relays it to decisionmakers.
These organizational processes may vary significantly across agencies.</p>
</div>
<div id="hypotheses-about-the-drivers-of-mass-mobilization" class="section level3" number="2.2.8">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.8</span> Hypotheses About the Drivers of Mass Mobilization</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Outsider Hypothesis:</strong> Lobbying coalitions
mobilize mass engagement when they perceive the attentive public is on
their side, have sufficient resources and perceive an opportunity to
influence policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key part of this hypothesis is that mobilizing is correlated with
existing public support, what might be called “grass-roots” support.</p>
<p>The
converse—that organizations mobilize when they have less public
support—could also be true. For example, business groups that are
already advantaged in low salience rulemaking may decide to leverage
their superior resources further to mobilize support to alter a bad
reputation or bolster claims that they represent more than their private
interest. If mobilization most often takes this “astroturf” form, this
would be evidence against
Outsider Hypothesis and Schattschneider’s argument that it is the
disadvantaged who seek to expand the scope of the conflict.</p>

<p>Public pressure campaigns are most often mobilized by the side with more resources.</p>
<p>The latter parts of Outsider Hypothesis regarding sufficient resources and political
opportunity are scope conditions. Most organizations that are
disadvantaged in low-salience rulemaking also lack resources to launch
mass mobilization campaigns. If an organization does not perceive a
lobbying opportunity, it would be incorrect to call mobilization a
lobbying strategy. Many factors may contribute to perceived political
opportunities. For example, <span class="citation">Moore (<a href="#ref-Moore2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> finds that agencies that use high
levels of expertise (as defined by <span class="citation">Selin (<a href="#ref-Selin2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>) receive fewer comments,
possibly because mobilizing organizations perceive these rules to be
less open to influence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 1b:</strong> When a lobbying coalition with more intense public support mobilizes successfully in response to an opportunity to influence policy, opposing coalitions with less public support are more likely to countermobilize, but with proportionally smaller results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first part of Hypothesis 1b would be undermined if lobbying organizations
with less public support are no more likely to engage in outside
lobbying when their opponents do so. While <span class="citation">Potter (<a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a><a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> found industry
groups were no more likely to advocate for rules to be strengthened,
weakened or withdrawn, this does not mean that they are no more likely
to mobilize when their opponents do so.</p>
<p>The second part of this hypothesis—that countermobilization is
proportionally smaller—rests on the intuition that the scale and the intensity of public engagement are moderated by preexisting support for
the proposition that people are being asked to support. It is possible
that the “potentially mobilized” segments of the public are unrelated to
public support before being contacted by the campaign, for example, if
mobilization is driven more by partisan identities than issue
preferences.</p>
<p>(ref:public interest) Hypothesis 1c</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>(ref:public interest):</strong> Public interest group coalitions mobilize more often than
business-driven coalitions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(ref:public interest) posits a conditional logic in the
decision to mobilize. If resources purely determined outside lobbying,
business-driven coalitions would often dominate, as they do elsewhere.
However, I argue, because outside lobbying can alter the decision
environment, those who have the advantage in the usual rulemaking
process (where a more limited set of actors participate) have little
incentive to expand the scope of the conflict.</p>

rules (over 16,000 proposed rules from 144 agencies from 2005 to 2020). Of these, public pressure campaigns targeted approximately 400 rules from 46 agencies.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Methods: Measuring Public Pressure and Political Information</h3>
<p>To identify the groups mobilizing public pressure campaigns, I develop methods to attribute individual comments to the
campaigns that mobilized them and to measure the intensity of preferences
expressed. To link individual comments to the more sophisticated
lobbying efforts they support, I first use textual similarity to identify
clusters of similar comments, reflecting formal and informal coalitions.
Comments with identical text (if any) indicate a coordinated campaign. Through an iterative process of hand-coding and computational methods, I then identify the organization responsible for mobilizing each comment and group organizations into coalitions.</p>
<p>For each campaign, I measure
the intensity and potential for the movement to grow. To measure
intensity, I examine the ratio of high-effort and low-effort comments.
To measure the potential to grow, I measure the number of comments mobilized
indirectly by the campaign (i.e., those that support a campaign but do
not include text provided by the campaign). The result is several new
measures of participation in bureaucratic policymaking.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3.1</span> Individuals</h4>
<p>The solicitation on regulations.gov–“Let your voice be heard”–suggests that individuals are expressing themselves directly. Indeed, anyone can write a letter or type a comment in the text box on regulations.gov, and many people do. Individuals acting on their own submit content ranging from obscenities and memes to detailed personal accounts of how a policy would affect them and even poetry aimed at changing officials’ hearts and minds.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Verba and Nie (<a href="#ref-Verba1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span> distinguish “citizen initiated contacts” from “cooperative activity” (pg. 54).

He advocates for institutional reforms that would make it easier for individuals to participated and increase the sophistication of individual comments on proposed policies.</p>
<p>The remaining forms of participation are all mediated through an organization’s pressure campaign. Comments from people mobilized as part of a campaign differ from those of individuals acting on their own in two ways: they often mention the name of the organization that mobilized them, and the text will often be similar or identical to other comments in the campaign, reflecting coordination. These features eliminate the value that <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Cuellar2015"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> and others see in individual comments. If comments reference an organization that mobilized them, they likely have more to offer than that the more sophisticated organization has not already provided. If comments are identical, they certainly provide no new information.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3.2</span> Membership Organizations</h4>
<p>If most commenters are members of membership organizations as <span class="citation">Kerwin and Furlong (<a href="#ref-Kerwin2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> suggest, a large campaign of, say one million people, will require a large collection of membership organizations. Very few organizations have a million members, and those that do are unlikely to mobilize all of them, so mobilizing a large number of people will usually require a large coalition of membership organizations. Commenters should identify themselves as members of these many organizations.</p>
</div>
<div id="policy-change-organizations" class="section level4" number="2.3.3.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3.3</span> Policy change organizations</h4>
<p>Mobilizing people just for a particular policy fight requires a significant organizing capacity. <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="McNutt2007"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> calls these formations “policy change organizations.”
There is a spectrum of organizing the unorganized. The poles might be labeled “grassroots” and “astroturf.” On the grassroots end, engagement is driven by a combination of passionate volunteerism and a supportive, attentive public <span class="citation">(Key <a href="#ref-Key1961" role="doc-biblioref">1961</a>)</span> or issue public <span class="citation">(Converse <a href="#ref-Converse1964" role="doc-biblioref">1964</a>)</span>. In practice, the campaigns that most resemble the grassroots ideal are not pure volunteerism but are organized by policy change organizations like Credo Action and Organizing For American on the left and Americans for Prosperity on the right.</p>
<p>These organizations have large mailing lists and media operations. Membership organizations like the Sierra Club may often mobilize beyond their membership base and thus take the form of a policy change organization as well.</p>
<p>Like people mobilized through their membership organizations, people mobilized by policy change organizations will often cite the mobilizing organization.<br />
Unlike those mobilized through membership organizations, mobilization by policy change organizations is more likely to be concentrated in a few large organizations with the specific resources for running campaigns that engage passionate or interested but unaffiliated segments of the public.</p>
</div>
<div id="astroturf" class="section level4" number="2.3.3.4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3.4</span> Astroturf</h4>
<p>Toward the astroturf end of the spectrum of policy change organizations, well-funded efforts gather signatures from a much less passionate and attentive population. Where grassroots organizing relies on existing underlying interests that merely need to be given an opportunity to engage, people engaged by astroturf campaigns are generally disinterested in the policy and engage merely because of paid ads or petition gathering, often involving some deception in order to get people to take action on an issue that they would not take if the issue was presented more clearly. Likewise, the organizations actually collecting the signatures would have no interest in doing so if they were not being paid. The aim is to give an appearance of support.</p>
<p>For example, Access Financial and other payday lending companies sponsored two campaigns targeting a regulation proposed by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2016. First, Access Financial had their employees solicit comments from customers, which Access then uploaded to regulations.gov. Many customer letters contained some version of “I have been told that payday loans would not exist in my community if the government’s proposed regulations went into effect.” The customer comments suggest that they had not been told much about the rule, which limited interest rates and the number of times short term loans could be compounded. Most customers wrote some version of “Do not close this store”–a few even complained about exactly the issues that CFPB’s regulation aimed to address. One customer wrote “Although some of the fees are a bit high, it should be my choice whether to get a loan or not” (Access Financial Comment 91130). Another wrote “I need to keep recieving my Check’n’Go loans so I can have the time to start paying them back in the next 1 1/2 to 2 years” (Access Financial Comment 91130) indicating that Check’n’Go (a subsidiary of Access Financial) was engged in serial re-lending that put this customer deeper in debt. To the extent that this campaign relied on deception and not the customer’s interests (even as the customers understood them), this would count as astroturf. Second, Access sponsored an effort to gather petition signatures at churches. Finally, Access and other payday loan companies uploaded supportive notes from community organizations to which they had given money. Like the churchgoers, these people had no reason to comment except that they had received money from the potentially regulated companies.</p>
<p>Spotting astroturf in the wild is difficult by design. However, the clear observable result is a large number of comments advocating on behalf of large business interests. These are the organizations with the resources and incentives to sponsor astroturf campaigns, and they do [Lyon2005].</p>

Astroturf: Interest Group Lobbying and Corporate Strategy
Thomas P. Lyon  John W. Maxwell

- in which the firm covertly subsidizes a group with similar views to lobby when it normally would not;
Lloyd Bentsen, a long‐time senator from Texas, describes the artificial grassroots campaigns created by public relations (PR) firms (Stauber and Rampton, 1995, p. 79)
For example, Lupia and McCubbins (1994) and de Figueiredo et al. (1999) study how administrative procedures can be designed to optimize the flow of information to politicians, and Baron (2001) develops a model in which activists attempt to influence corporate strategy via the threat of consumer boycotts. Kollman (1998) studies the motivations and strategy behind lobbying behavior based on detailed interviews with 90 interest group leaders. Grossman and Helpman (2001) provide an excellent introduction to the recent theoretical literature on interest group politics.

Astroturf, quite simply, is synthetic grassroots organizing created for manipulative political purposes (see Lyon &
Maxwell, 2004; Allen, 1998; Austin, 2002). In this type of activity, an entity that wishes to affect public policy creates an effort
that gives the appearance of grassroots support

<p>Metadata on the authors of comments and their

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.4.1</span> Mobilizing organizations</h4>
<p>Through an iterative combination of automated search methods and hand-coding, I identify the organization responsible for over 40 million comments, including all organizations responsible for mobilizing 100 or more
comments with repeated text–either identical text or partially unique texts that contain shared language. I then searched comment texts for
mentions of these organizations’ names to complete missing information
on the mobilizing organization.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.5</span> Who lobbies together?</h3>
<p>Having identified who is participating in rulemaking, the next step is
to determine who is lobbying together. Studies of rulemaking stress the importance of coalitions <span class="citation">(J. W. Yackee and Yackee <a href="#ref-Yackee2006JOP" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>; Dwidar <a href="#ref-Dwidar2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>. Scholars have measured coalitions of organized groups but have yet to attribute citizen comments to the coalition that mobilized them.</p>
<div id="identifying-coalitions-using-text-reuse" class="section level4" number="2.3.5.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.5.1</span> Identifying coalitions using text reuse</h4>
<p>I identify comments that are not identical but share a 10-word (or
“10-gram”) string using a moving window function looping over each
possible pair of texts to identify matches.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a>
When actors sign onto the same comment, it is clear that they are
lobbying together. However, various businesses, advocacy groups, and
citizens often comment separately, even when they are aligned. Text-reuse (using the exact same ten-word phrases) captures this alignment.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="whymail.html#fig:percent-match">2.6</a> shows the percent of shared text for a sample of 50 comments on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s 2016 Rule regulating Payday Loans. Comments are arranged by the document identifier assigned by regulations.gov on both axes.
The black on the diagonal indicates that each document has perfect overlap with itself. Black squares off the diagonal indicate additional pairs of identical documents. For example, 100% of the words from Comment 95976 are part of some tengram that also appears in 95977 because the exact same comment was uploaded twice.
The block of grey squares indicates a coalition of commenters using some identical text.
Comments <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CFPB-2016-0025-91130">91130</a> through <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CFPB-2016-0025-91154">91156</a> are all partial or exact matches. Most are part of a mass comment campaign by Access Financial. The percent of the identical text is lower than many mass-comment campaigns because these are hand-written comments, but the n-gram method still picks up overlap in the OCRed text in the header and footer.</p>

<!--  Identifying coalitions using clustering methods
I use statistical models of text to classify comments into coalitions. I cluster
documents by the frequency with which they use different words. Being
classified together does not mean that the documents all address exactly
the same distribution of substantive issues, just that they use similar
words relative to the full set of documents. I start by modeling all
comments on each rule (collapsing identical comments to one document)
with two and three clusters, which I then inspect to see how well the
comments of named organizations were classified. If the two cluster
model most sensibly describes the conflict, I label these clusters "pro" and "con" If the three-cluster model more sensibly describes the
conflict, I label these clusters as "pro, con, other." If neither fits
well, I increase the number of clusters as needed.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="Figs/kmeans.png" alt="K-means clustering fails to capture coalitions when nearly all comments oppose a regulation" width="100%"  />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:kmeans)K-means clustering fails to capture coalitions when nearly all comments oppose a regulation</p>
</div>


The asymmetry in expressed support for most rules presents challenges
for unsupervised clustering because much of the variation in comment
texts is within-coalition variation. For example, one of the most common
clustering methods, k-means clustering, often captures within-coalition
variation. Figure \@ref(fig:kmeans) shows k-means clusters based on a normalized
measure of word frequency (term-frequency/inverse-document-frequency)
compared to two principal components of variation. Neither k-means nor
principal components analysis is well suited to identifying the small
number of comments supporting the Park Service's proposed restrictions
on protests in Washington DC.

Two strategies may improve clustering. First, even partial text reuse
generally indicates that comments belong to the same coalition. For
example, as seen at the top of Figure
\@ref(fig:kmeans), models may be restricted to cluster the large number of comments beginning with
"As a citizen who has frequently participated" in the same coalition
even if they go on to add different personal anecdotes about why protest
rights are important to them. Thus, clustering methods could be
restricted to group partially copied texts, as well as entirely copied
texts. Second, a Bayesian mixture model may better recover pro and con
clusters, especially with strong priors comments using positive and
negative sentiment words belong together.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.6</span> Measuring the volume, intensity, and potential contagion of public engagement</h3>
<p>I measure variation in engagement in three ways, corresponding to the
three types of comments described above.</p>
<p><strong>Volume.</strong>
First, I measure the total number of comments on the rule.
Commenting results from multiple processes. First, a group must decide to
lobby. Then, a group must decide to mobilize public pressure. Finally, the resulting number of comments depends on the response to the
campaign. There may be many cases where groups may have had
success mobilizing but never reached the choice of whether to mobilize
or not. For example, relevant groups may have been unaware of the draft rule. Once the decision
to mobilize has been reached and made, the response to mobilizing is a
count process. Thus, I expect the count of comments across rules to
follow a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Effort.</strong>
I measure effort per comment by the number of words people
write, omitting any text longer than ten words not unique to that comment,
usually because a mobilizing organization provided it. For example, the Sierra Club mobilized more than 47,710
people to submit exactly the same text on the delay of the methane
pollution rule, but 7,452 people also took the time to write a
personalized comment in addition to the text provided (see Figure <a href="whymail.html#fig:sierra">2.4</a>).
Completely unique comments (those that do not copy text from a form letter at all) generally indicated high levels of effort. As <span class="citation">Verba and Nie (<a href="#ref-Verba1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span> note, signing a form letter requires “some” effort, writing an original letter to a government official requires “a lot” of “initiative” (effort). The longer the letter, the more effort required.</p>
<p>While effort, as measured by the number of words people write, may be normally distributed, the low end of the observed distribution is truncated.
This is because we will not observe people who have low levels of passion for the issue; they either do not cross the effort threshold required to comment or opt
to write nothing more than the form letter.</p>
<p><strong>Contagion.</strong> Mass-comment campaigns have wildly different results.
Some organizations submit a clean 10,000 copies of (signatures on) the same comment.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>
Others “go viral”—inspiring a mess of further engagement where the
original messages are translated through social media posts and news
stories. To identify people who were plausibly mobilized indirectly by a
campaign, I count the number of people who use a similar distribution of
words to that of the form letter but fewer than ten words matching any
other comment. This is a regular count process.</p>

<p>Figure
<a href="whymail.html#fig:comments-support">2.7</a> shows all comments posted on
regulations.gov over time by whether they are exact or partial copies of
another comment or not. I call comments that have between 2 and 99
identical copies, “medium batch” because such comments may reflect
coordinated efforts among interest groups that do not include a public
pressure strategy that involves mobilizing ordinary people. Even relatively unsuccessful public pressure campaigns yield far more than 99 comments. Comments with either 100 or more identical copies or were uploaded in bulk batches of at least 100 are then “mass comments” that were certainly mobilized by a public pressure campaign. Figure <a href="whymail.html#fig:comments-support">2.7</a> shows that public pressure campaigns mobilize the vast majority of comments.</p>

<p>The right pane of Figure
<a href="whymail.html#fig:comments-support">2.7</a> shows results from a sample of several
million comments for which I have digitized texts. Many of these
comments appear to support proposed agency rules. A rough measure of
support (whether the comment text includes " support " or " oppose “)
shows that many more comments mention support, until 2018 when there is
a fairly dramatic reversal in the share of comments mentioning”support
" compared to those mentioning “oppose” (Figure <a href="whymail.html#fig:comments-support">2.7</a>. This may be a function of the
changing regulatory agenda due to the change in the presidential
administration. However, “support” and “oppose” are not used in all comments

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.3.1</span> A coalition of public-interest organizations mobilize most comments.</h4>
<p>As Figure <a href="whymail.html#fig:topdockets">2.9</a> shows, the most prolific mobilizers are
environmental groups. On five out of the top ten dockets (here including
rulemaking and non-rulemaking dockets), a similar coalition of groups
mobilized most public comments. In part, this is because the
Environmental Protection Agency produces a large share of the
substantive rules posted to regulations.gov. However, it is notable
that 19 of the top 20 mobilizers generally
lobby together on the top ten dockets. America’s Energy Cooperatives (AEC), an industry association,
stands out as the lone mobilizer on behalf of its
members’ material interest. Notably, it only mobilized significantly on the Clean Power
Plan but not on the subsequent Clean Power Plan repeal. If public
interest group mobilizing on the Clean Power Plan was an example of
“going public” to pressure the Obama administration and then “going
down fighting” in the face of the Trump administration’s repeal,
industry counter-mobilization responding to the first, but not the
second aligns with Hypothesis 1b. If AEC found their policy goals in the Clean Power Plan rulemaking threatened by the political information being generated by environmental groups, it would make sense to devote resources to their own public pressure campaign to disrupt any perceived consensus. Likewise, if AEC was not concerned that environmental group mobilizing would affect the Clean Power Plan repeal, sponsoring a public pressure campaign would be a poor investment.</p>

<span class="citation">Potter (<a href="#ref-Potter2014dis" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> develops a signaling model where agencies propose and principals veto rules depending, in part, on their beliefs about interest group preferences.
On interest-group balancing, see <span class="citation">J. W. Yackee and Yackee (<a href="#ref-Yackee2006JOP" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">S. W. Yackee (<a href="#ref-Yackee2006JPART" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>,
and <span class="citation">Kerwin and Furlong (<a href="#ref-Kerwin2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>. A key assumption of Libgober’s (2018) model is that
bureaucrats have a distribution of preferences over interest group
positions, about which they are uncertain unless groups reveal their
preferences through commenting.<a href="whymail.html#fnref9" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Some of the most contentious recent public controversies involve bureaucratic policymaking. For example, along with 50 thousand
protesters in Washington D.C., the State Department Received 1.2
million comments on the Environmental Impact Statement for the
Keystone Pipeline. Similarly, along with the thousands of protesters
supporting the Standing Rock Sioux protest to the Dakota Access
Pipeline, the Army Corps of Engineers received hundreds of thousands of comments. Alongside protest actions that included shutting down many websites, the Federal Communications Commission’s open internet rule received 22 million comments. While some of these comments appear to be fake, the scale of public engagement is remarkable given how little attention political scientists have paid to it.
Fake public comments also raise the question of why an organization
would bother to generate fake public input if it did not matter, as
its omission from theories of bureaucratic policymaking would seem
to imply.<a href="whymail.html#fnref10" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>Proposed rules that have attracted the most public attention have
been published by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC,
omitted from this plot), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
the Department of Interior (DOI), the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management (BOEM), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB),
and Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).<a href="whymail.html#fnref11" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>I focus on public comments in rulemaking, but the theories and methods here may also apply to other kinds of political engagement such as through social media or protests as well as to other political decisions, including state-level rulemaking. Social media
engagement may be especially important if agencies implement the
recommendations of <span class="citation">ACUS (<a href="#ref-ACUS2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> that “Agencies should consider using
social media before or in connection with direct final rulemaking to
quickly identify whether there are significant or meaningful
objections” (p. 34).<a href="whymail.html#fnref12" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>At least for agencies participating in regulations.gov. See
sections
<a href="whymail.html#why-methods">2.3.2</a> and
<a href="whymail.html#why-results">2.4</a> for my definition and methods for identifying mass comments.<a href="whymail.html#fnref13" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>If we define “civic participation” as “acts aimed at influencing governmental decisions <span class="citation">(Verba and Nie <a href="#ref-Verba1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>, 2)</span>, signing a petition or form comment counts. However, some consider true
participation to be deliberative, which mass comment campaigns are not.
Other criteria posed by normative theorists that participation should be”genuine," “informed,” or “reasoned” are more difficult to assess. Normative theorists may debate whether deliberation among a small number of people is preferable to a large number of people simply expressing their preferences, but empirically, public participation in bureaucratic policymaking is much more the latter <span class="citation">(Shapiro <a href="#ref-Shapiro2008b" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>.<a href="whymail.html#fnref14" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>Diamonds indicate observable choices, ovals indicate latent preferences and rectangles indicate information.<a href="whymail.html#fnref15" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>I address other types of political information that mass engagement may create elsewhere. For an expanded model, see Figure
<a href="#fig:causal-full"><strong>??</strong></a>. <a href="whymail.html#fnref16" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>Public support can be faked or inflated using “astroturf” tactics, but such campaigns have observably different patterns of engagement.<a href="whymail.html#fnref17" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>“Going public,” “outside lobbying,” or an “outside strategy” contrasts with insider lobbying. It is used by Presidents
<span class="citation">(Kernell <a href="#ref-Kernell2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>, Members of Congress <span class="citation">(Malecha and Reagan <a href="#ref-Malecha2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>, interest groups
<span class="citation">(Walker <a href="#ref-Walker1991" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a>; Dür and Mateo <a href="#ref-Dur2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, Lawyers, and Judges (Davis 2011). For
example, organizations may use phone banks, targeting strategies,
and direct-mail techniques to drum up and channel public support
(Cooper 1985).<a href="whymail.html#fnref18" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>This strategy is likely to be used by those disadvantaged (those
<span class="citation">Schattschneider (<a href="#ref-Schattschneider1975" role="doc-biblioref">1975</a>)</span> calls the ‘losers’) in a policy process with
less public attention.<a href="whymail.html#fnref19" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>

not clear if this is a result of strategic calculation, a perceived
obligation due to the normative power of consensus (e.g., following
a majoritarian logic <span class="citation">(Mendelson <a href="#ref-Mendelson2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>), or simply that unified
demands are easier to process than opposing demands.<a href="whymail.html#fnref20" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p><span class="citation">Potter (<a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a><a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> similarly distinguishes “advocacy groups” from
“industry groups.” <span class="citation">Berry (<a href="#ref-Berry1999" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>)</span> calls these groups “citizen groups” and emphasizes conflict over cultural issues. While some public
interest groups focus on conservative or progressive cultural
issues, like religious education, immigration, or endangered
species, many are more focused on the public provision or protection
of public goods such as national parks, consumer product safety
standards, air quality, drinking water, and public safety.
One exception may be types of membership organizations that are both
broad and often focused on material outcomes for their members, such
as labor unions. <span class="citation">Potter (<a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a><a href="#ref-Potter2017" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> puts unions in the “Industry” category.
I take a different approach based on the coalition with whom such
groups lobby. If a union lobbies alongside businesses (see <span class="citation">Mildenberger (<a href="#ref-Mildenberger2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>), I classify
this as a private interest-driven coalition. If a union lobbies with
public interest groups on public health or safety issues, I classify
this as a public interest.<a href="whymail.html#fnref21" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>It is possible that some people in this latter category engage purely on their own initiative, but any impact they have likely comes from their alignment with a coalition. Furthermore, as I show
below, wholly original comments are rare.<a href="whymail.html#fnref22" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
