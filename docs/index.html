<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Does civic engagement through public pressure campaigns affect agency rulemaking? I examine who participates in public pressure campaigns and why, whether they affect congressional oversight, and whether they affect policy. Answering these questions informs our understanding of bureaucratic politics and interest group lobbying, organizing, and mobilizing tactics. If ordinary people have a voice in bureaucratic policymaking, I argue, it is through public pressure campaings. Thus, understnding the nature and effects of these campaigns is key to understanding modern democracy.</p>

<p>With the rise of the administrative state, U.S. federal agencies have
become a major site of policymaking and political conflict. By some
estimates, upward of 90% of legally binding U.S. federal policy is now
written by agencies. Agency rules are revised much more frequently than
statutory law <span class="citation">(Wagner et al. <a href="#ref-Wagner2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. In the years or decades between
legislative enactments, federal agencies make legally-binding rules
interpreting and reinterpreting old statutes to address emerging issues
and priorities. Examples are striking: Many effects of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act were largely unknown until the
specific regulations were written, and it continues to change as these
rules are revised. Congress authorizes billions in grants, subsidies, and
leases for public lands, but who gets them depends on agency policy. In
the decades since the last major environmental legislation, agencies
have written thousands of pages of new environmental regulations and
thousands more changing tack under each new administration. These
revisions significantly shape lives and fortunes. For example, in 2006,
citing the authority of statutes last amended in the 1950s, the Justice
Department’s Bureau of Prisons proposed a rule restricting eligibility
for parole. In 2016, the Bureau withdrew this rule and announced it
would require fewer contracts with prison companies,
precipitating a 50% loss of industry stock value. Six months later, a
new administration announced these policies would again be reversed,
leading to a 130% increase in industry stock value. Agency rulemaking
matters.</p>
<p>Less clear, however, is how the new centrality of agency rulemaking fits
with democracy. In addition to the bureaucracy’s complex relationships with
the president and Congress, agencies have complex and poorly understood
relationships with the public and advocacy groups. Relationships with
constituent groups may even provide agencies with a degree of “autonomy” from their official principals <span class="citation">(Carpenter <a href="#ref-Carpenter2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Participatory processes like public comment periods, where government
agencies must solicit public input on draft policies, are said to
provide political oversight opportunities <span class="citation">(Balla <a href="#ref-Balla1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>; Mccubbins and Schwartz <a href="#ref-Mccubbins1984" role="doc-biblioref">1984</a>)</span>,
democratic legitimacy <span class="citation">(Croley <a href="#ref-Croley2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Rosenbloom <a href="#ref-Rosenbloom2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>, and new technical
information <span class="citation">(Yackee <a href="#ref-Yackee2006JPART" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>; Nelson and Yackee <a href="#ref-Nelson2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. While recent scholarship on
agency policymaking has shed light on the sophisticated lobbying by
businesses and political insiders, we know surprisingly little about the
vast majority of public comments which are submitted by ordinary people
as part of public pressure campaigns.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Activists frequently target
agency policymaking with letter-writing campaigns, petitions, protests,
and mobilizing people to attend hearings, all classic examples of “civic
engagement” <span class="citation">(Verba and Nie <a href="#ref-Verba1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span>. Yet civic engagement remains poorly understood
in the context of bureaucratic policymaking.</p>
<p>These occasional bursts of civic engagement in bureaucratic policymaking
raise practical and theoretical questions for the practice of
democracy.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> These questions, in turn, hinge on unanswered empirical
questions: Do these campaigns affect policy? If so, by what mechanisms?
Existing research finds that commenters believe their comments matter
<span class="citation">(Yackee <a href="#ref-Yackee2015JPART" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> and that the number of public comments varies across
agencies and policy processes
<span class="citation">(Judge-Lord <a href="#ref-Judge-Lord2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>; Libgober <a href="#ref-Libgober2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>; Moore <a href="#ref-Moore2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, but the relationship
between the scale of public engagement and policy change remains
untested.</p>

<div id="motivation" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Leading models of influence in bureaucratic policymaking focus on two key political forces: sophisticated interest group lobbying and political oversight.
As bureaucrats learn about policy problems and balance interest-group demands, public comment processes allow lobbying organizations to provide useful technical information and inform decisionmakers of their preferences on draft policies.
Agencies may then update policy positions within constraints imposed by their political principals.</p>
<p>While this may describe most cases of bureaucratic policymaking, these models do not explain or account for the contentious politics that occasionally inspire millions of ordinary people to respond to calls for public input on draft agency policies. Mass engagement in bureaucratic policymaking has thus largely been ignored by political scientists, leaving a weak empirical base for normative and prescriptive work.
Like other forms of mass political participation, such as protests and letter writing campaigns,
mass public comments on draft agency rules provide no new technical information. <!--%In this sense, they are not useful. -->
Nor do they wield any formal authority to reward or sanction bureaucrats, as comments from a Members of Congress might.
The number on each side, be it ten or ten million, has no legal import for an agency’s response.</p>
<!--
% Policymakers may very well pay no attention to them. 
%Instead, scholars focus on the sophisticated lobbying efforts of powerful interest groups, whose role in shaping policy has been theoretically developed and empirically tested.
% If our models and conventional wisdom is correct, why do
Yet agencies occasionally receive input from a large number of ordinary people. %Why? 
-->
<p>How, if at all, should scholars incorporate mass engagement into models of bureaucratic policymaking?</p>

<h2>Outline of the book</h2>
<p>This dissertation explores the effects of public pressure campaigns on agency rulemaking, a technocratic policy process where “public participation” is usually limited to sophisticated lobbying but occasionally includes millions of people mobilized by public pressure campaigns. Public comment periods on proposed policies purport to provide democratic accountability. Yet theories of bureaucratic policymaking largely ignore the occasional bursts of civic engagement that generate the vast majority of public comments on proposed rules. To fill this gap, I build and test theories about the role of public pressure in policymaking. I collect and analyze millions of public comments to develop the first systematic measures of civic engagement and influence in bureaucratic policymaking.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 1 “Agency Rulemaking in American Politics”</strong> situates agency rulemaking in the context of American politics. Tracing broad trends over the past 40 years, I show that rulemaking has become a major site of policymaking and political conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2 “Why Do Agencies (Sometimes) Get So Much Mail?”</strong> addresses who participates in public pressure campaigns and why. Are public pressure campaigns, like other lobbying tactics, primarily used by well-resourced groups to create an “astroturf” impression of public support? Or are they better understood as conflict expansion tactics used by less-resourced “grassroots” groups? I find that mass comment campaigns are almost always a conflict expansion tactic. Furthermore, I find no evidence of negativity bias in public comments. Indeed, from 2005 to 2017, most comments supported proposed rules. This is because public comments tend to support Democratic policies and oppose Republican policies, reflecting the asymmetry in mobilizing groups.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3 “Do Public Pressure Campaigns Influence Congressional Oversight?”</strong> examines the effect of public pressure campaigns on whether legislators are more likely to engage in rulemaking. This involves collecting and coding thousands of comments from Members of Congress on proposed rules with and without public pressure campaigns. These data also allow me to assess congressional oversight as a mediator in policy influence, i.e., the extent to which public pressure campaigns affect policy indirectly through their effects on legislators’ oversight behaviors.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4 “Do Public Pressure Campaigns Influence Policy?”</strong> leverages a mix of hand-coding and computational text analysis methods to assess whether public pressure campaigns increase lobbying success. To measure lobbying success, I develop computational methods to identify lobbying coalitions and estimate their effect on each rule posted for comment on regulations.gov. I then validate these methods against a random sample of 100 rules with a mass-comment campaign and 100 rules without a mass-comment campaign, hand-coded for whether each coalition got the policy outcome they sought. Finally, I assess potential mechanisms by which mass public engagement may affect policy.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5 “The Environmental Justice Movement and Technocratic Policymaking”</strong> examines the discursive effects of environmental justice claims both qualitatively and quantitatively. I write about the role of Native activists and environmental groups in shaping federal environmental regulations. Looking across over 20,000 draft regulations that failed to address environmental justice issues, I find that agencies are more likely to add language addressing environmental justice in their final rules when public comments raise environmental justice concerns.</p>
