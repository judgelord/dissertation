<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Do the issues that dominate political discourse translate into actual policy? To the extent that broad theories of American politics go beyond the results of elections and attempt to explain the resulting policies, they generally focus on landmark legislation and items at the top of presidential agendas. Yet as the administrative state and our understanding of it have grown, political scientists are increasingly paying attention to policy outputs both for their own sake and how policy outputs shape politics.</p>
<p>Agency rules and regulations are where the rubber hits the road for both legislation and presidential agendas <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Yackee2009bush" role="doc-biblioref">J. W. Yackee and Yackee 2009b</a>)</span>. Ninety percent of U.S. law is now written by agencies rather than Congress <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-West2013" role="doc-biblioref">West and Raso 2013</a>)</span>, and the real impact of most new statutes and executive orders is largely unknown until the ink is dry on the agency rules and regulations that implement them.
Legally binding regulations give specific meaning and force to legislation and presidential agendas.</p>
<p>As the substantive outputs of policy processes, if changes in public attention or opinion and the priorities of elected leaders matter for policy, we should expect to see these changes borne out in the number and type of agency rules published. Changes in outputs may reflect changes in the substantive inputs—sometimes called the “issue structure” —or changes in how issues are filtered and activated by the institutional structures of policymaking.</p>
<p>This chapter martials data on federal agency policymaking from 1980 to 2020 to sketch broad trends in federal policymaking. Broad theories of American politics suggest three types of predictions: (1) patterns in the substantive issues addressed by policy, (2) patterns in the relationship between partisan control and issue attention, and (3) patterns in the pace of policy change. The systematic data on agency rulemaking that I introduce here permit us to assess the extent to which broad theories of American politics explain the substance, timing, and volume of policy outputs.</p>
<p>This exercise has two purposes. First, I aim to introduce a large new dataset on federal policymaking and situate these data in the broader context of American politics. Second, I contrast the hard data with broad political science theories. This assessment is descriptive and intended to be provocative—an attempt to stretch the conceptual ground of theories of American politics to include the massive, yet often-neglected, volume of concrete policy outcomes. The extent to which the match between theory and data is unsatisfying may point toward opportunities for theorizing, a narrow portion of which I take up in the following chapters that focus squarely on expanding theories of bureaucratic policymaking.</p>

<p>There are many causal pathways between public opinion and attention and policy outcomes, but most are long and complex.

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2.2</span> Issue Ownership and the Politics of Attention</h4>
<p>Concerning the anticipated level of attention paid to different policy areas, theories of American politics that focus on substance can be lumped into two types: (1) those that generally predict that both parties pay attention to the same issues at the same time (theories of partisan alignment (e.g., Sundquist) and (2) those that generally predict that parties pay attention to different issues (including both theories of party ideologies (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Gerring1998" role="doc-biblioref">Gerring</a> (<a href="#ref-Gerring1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span>) and theories of party coalitions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Schlozman2015" role="doc-biblioref">D. Schlozman 2015</a>)</span>. In each case, the particular issues may vary more or less dramatically depending on how sharply one defines historical periods (compare the issue evolution perspectives <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Carmines1989" role="doc-biblioref">Carmines and Stimson 1989</a>)</span> with critical elections perspectives <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Key1961" role="doc-biblioref">Key 1961</a>)</span>). Indeed as Shafer (2016) notes, some periods may end quickly and others slowly. Given the limited time period of this paper, I focus on the dominant policy issues, their relationship to party control, and the pace of policymaking rather than the timing or pace of transition between periods.</p>
<p>These two types of theories generate broadly contrasting predictions about what we expect the government to do under various configurations of party control.</p>
<p>For partisan alignment theories, we would expect to see agency policymaking dominated by the major issues of the day under both parties. Parties may have opposite positions on these issues leading the agencies to be pulled in opposite directions by political leaders, but the agencies’ set of dominant policy issues demanding attention will remain largely the same. Indeed, the push and pull should lead to sustained high volumes of policy, as presidential administrations and congresses reverse policies made by their predators or by other branches. Occasionally, an agency with somewhat overlapping authority may be given control of a program taken from an adjacent agency <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Carpenter2001" role="doc-biblioref">D. P. Carpenter 2001</a>)</span>, but the broad policy area should be the same.</p>
<p>In contrast, for theories of party ideologies and party coalitions, party control should determine the issues to which government attends. Thus, partisan control should have a much larger effect on which agencies are making more policy. This may occur through positive agenda control that the president has to direct agency policymaking or negative agenda control through the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs review <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Haeder2015" role="doc-biblioref">Haeder and Yackee 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-Potter2016" role="doc-biblioref">Potter 2017b</a>)</span>. Negative agenda control is likely to dominate in Congress <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Cox2005" role="doc-biblioref">Cox and McCubbins 2005</a>)</span>, but the threat of Congressional action may be sufficient to influence agency policymaking <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Potter2016" role="doc-biblioref">Potter 2017b</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="the-implications-of-partisan-alignment" class="section level4" number="1.2.2.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2.3</span> The Implications of Partisan Alignment</h4>
<p>Partisan alignment theories necessarily identify dominant issue dimensions where each party is doing the opposite of the other. In Sundquist’s model, realignment can occur slowly or rapidly, whereas Manza and Brooks emphasize how social structures, and thus issues, change slowly. However, almost all prominent alignment theories identify 1980 through the present as one period (indeed, most see 1936 as the critical election that has oriented the modern era). Thus instead of engaging realignment theories on the issue of realignment, I draw on them for the issues that they claim constitute the dimension of the current alignment. By these theories, the dimensions of substantive conflict and thus the distribution of agency policymaking should be relatively stable over the period considered in this paper.</p>
<p>Realignment theories suggest that certain policy areas consistently dominate all others and, while the direction of policy will likely change, the issues will vary little with changes in partisan control. Presidential transitions may be marked by withdrawal or reversal of policies made under the previous administration, and Congress may overturn agency rules. Still, the relevant agencies will be the same, generally those dealing with social welfare.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-implications-of-issue-ownership-and-party-coalitions" class="section level4" number="1.2.2.4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2.4</span> The Implications of Issue Ownership and Party Coalitions</h4>
<p>The second type focuses on the differences of party ideologies, and its predictions are less clear. Gerring identifies distinct and consistent ideologies in both parties. Rather than a dominant dimension of conflict where parties respond to each other (as in alignment theories) or an underlying dimension of issue structure (e.g., Claggett and Shafer 2010), for Gerring, party ideologies are the policy agendas of party elites. “Party constituencies were generally conservative forces, whereas party elites were the agents of change” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Gerring1998" role="doc-biblioref">Gerring 1998</a>, pg. 272)</span>.</p>
<p>In the current era, Gerring argues, Republicans are driven by Neoliberalism and Democrats by Universalism. Like others, Gerring sees social values (behavioral norms) playing a prominent role in Republican policy agendas from 1980 to when the book was published in 1996 (see pg. 277). Yet, he argues, the platform’s core was neo-liberal opposition to the welfare state and promotion of free markets. In contrast, Gerring identifies the Democratic platform in this period as consistently emphasizing broad unifying issues like Medicare and education. While this more clearly suggests the policy areas likely to receive attention under Democrats than Republicans, it does generally imply that the policy agendas will be different, not simply opposite.</p>
<p>Under theories emphasizing party ideologies and interests, the volume of policymaking at different agencies may very well change substantially when a different party captures the presidency. Specifically, if <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Gerring1998" role="doc-biblioref">Gerring</a> (<a href="#ref-Gerring1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span> correctly identified the party ideologies of the current era, we would expect significantly more civil rights and welfare policymaking under Democratic administrations and more neoliberal economic policy under Republican administrations, especially when presidents’ co-partisans have majorities in Congress. Gerring’s distinction between Democrats statism and Republicans anti-statism may also suggest more rulemaking overall in Democrat administrations.</p>
<p>Perspectives focusing on interest groups and coalitions also suggest that issues will vary with party control. If parties contain coalitions of intense policy demanders <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Cohen2008" role="doc-biblioref">Cohen et al. 2008</a>; <a href="#ref-DiSalvo2012" role="doc-biblioref">DiSalvo 2012</a>)</span>, the issues to which they attend will reflect these different coalitions. Disalvo shares Gerring’s conclusion regarding the anti-statism of the Republican party. Most clearly, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Schlozman2015" role="doc-biblioref">D. Schlozman</a> (<a href="#ref-Schlozman2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> links Democratic politics and labor groups. While Schlozman emphasizes that labor groups frequently fall short of their goals within the Democratic coalition, no other group is a stronger anchor. We thus expect much more labor policy under Democratic administrations. As the interest groups Schlozman identifies anchoring the Republican party are focused on behavioral norms where policymaking is less concentrated in certain agencies, these predictions are less relevant. Again these co-partisans in Congress ought to increase these effects.</p>
<p>The above perspectives emphasize party difference, either on ideology (on the same issues for Sundquist, on different issues for Gerring) or anchoring interests. However, the observable implications are different. If party alignment theories explain policy outputs, the volume of agency rules will concentrate on the same agencies and issues, even as parties change. In contrast, if issue ownership and party coalition theories explain policy outputs, the volume of agency rules at different agencies should vary by partisan control. <!--In contrast, Samuel Huntington in The American Creed and Gary Hart emphasize commonality. Whereas Gerring finds "broad symbols that both parties appropriate—liberty, freedom, democracy, equal opportunity, and so forth, often mean fundamentally different things to spokespersons of different parties" (Gerring 1998, pg. 8), Huntington sees these as a core American ideology exerting an independent force on politics. --></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Policymaking and Policy Outcomes On Different Issues</h3>
<p><em>The American Political Pattern: Party Balance, Ideological Polarization, and Substantive Conflict, 1932-2016</em> (Shafer 2016) attempts to integrate the issue structure of politics and party control of the government. Patterns of the substance of conflict and balance of party control produce patterns of policymaking. Most clearly, Shafer observes a pattern of consistent major policymaking between 1980 and 1992 and a pattern of punctuated equilibrium after 1992. Such patterns of policymaking should be visible in patterns of rulemaking. Importantly, <em>The American Political Pattern</em> discusses not only landmark policies and agendas but also identifies distinct patterns of policymaking. The “Era of Divided Government” (1969-1992) saw a steady flow of major policies, especially regarding the economy and the environment, and was dominated by social welfare and cultural values and cross-partisan coalitions, suggesting that the volume of policy outputs should be concentrated on social policy and civil rights be fairly consistent across configurations of party control.</p>
<p>In contrast, the “Era of Partisan Volatility” (1992 through the present) is characterized by periods of policy stability and punctuation. This chapter aims to assess the extent to which patterns of agency policymaking fit these patterns.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>
Schafer characterizes this era by long stretches of policy stasis punctuated by spikes of activity. If these broad patterns explain policy outputs, we would expect to see a pattern of lulls and spikes in rulemaking. Furthermore, party control may lead to different types of policymaking moving together depending on partisan control. The observation of punctuated equilibrium in legislative policymaking could also suggest a pattern where, in the absence of new legislation, the president may have a larger effect over patterns of agency rulemaking.</p>
<p>Scholarship thus gives us predictions regarding the issues that dominate American politics and how party control will affect the translation of issues into policy. However, the two-fold space for disagreement raises a problem for studying policy outputs in the present analysis. If we do not see policymaking on an issue, it could be evidence that the issue was not as important as claimed or that the party in power deemphasized it. Only by assuming a certain issue structure or a certain theory of party effects could we say that an absence of policymaking supports one perspective or another regarding issues or institutional structure. The evidence is sufficient, however, to rule out some explanations. The remainder of the chapter focuses on consistencies and inconstancies between the evidence and theories, with no claim that consistency means the theory is correct.</p>
</div>
<div id="observed-patterns-in-policy-issues" class="section level3" number="1.2.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4</span> Observed Patterns in Policy Issues</h3>
<p>Following Mayhew (1991, 2008), Claggett and Shafer (2010) argue that the policy issues driving American politics vary over time. Drawing on public opinion polls and presidential platforms, they distinguish four broad categories of political issues: welfare, international relations, civil rights, and cultural issues. These categories are constructed to have policy-relevant content. Still, they do not perfectly align with how the government is organized, limiting our ability to categorize agency rules by their conceptual scheme. Nevertheless, their findings regarding the issue structure of American politics have observable implications for the quantity and substance of federal rulemaking.</p>
<p>Claggett and Shafer (2010) find that National Security was a major issue in 1984 but then faded until it emerged as the dominant issue of the 2004 election. Regarding their relationship with partisan control of the government, opinions on Foreign Engagement reversed the direction of correlation with presidential vote, suggesting that the first Bush and Clinton administrations may be more similar in their attention to foreign policy than the second Bush administration.</p>
<p>Welfare was also a top issue in 1984 but continued to be salient and the dominant issue in several subsequent elections. If politics affects the volume of policymaking, agency policymaking (e.g., the number of agency rules) should reflect this finding that social welfare is a major feature of American politics (Sundquist 1968, Claggett and Shafer 2010).</p>
<p>Claggett and Shafer found civil rights to be mildly salient in 1988, 1992, and 2000 but not elsewhere.
They find cultural issues (operationalized through a concept of “Behavioral Norms”) to be highly salient from 1992 to 2000. Unfortunately, what Claggett and Shafer call behavioral norms is either so distant from policy (e.g., women’s roles) or so fragmented across agencies (e.g., school prayer and abortion) that it is not possible to make predictions of the location of policymaking from patterns on this issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: Citations for environmental policy salience steadily decreasing in the 80s and 90s, uptick starting around 2010 or so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In sum, if the issue structure of politics shapes policy, past scholarship suggests that social welfare should be the leading policy type over all periods and for both parties. Social welfare is identified as a dominant dimension of party alignment and issue structure in public opinion.</p>

<div id="data" class="section level2" number="1.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Data</h2>
<p>This exercise compares research on the social structure and political behavior of the American public and political elites with what government actually does. Agency rulemaking is driven in part by laws passed by Congress and in part by the president’s agenda. Discrepancies may indicate either a true disconnect between electoral politics and executive action or that executive policymaking was constrained by other political forces.</p>
<p>Connecting broad theories of the American political landscape to the nuanced daily actions of government is not easy. I focus on relatively fine-grain policy outputs, final rules published by agencies in the Federal Register and reported to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. This approach has the advantage of capturing the making of law as it is, not how it is framed by elites or thought of by the electorate. The disadvantage is its distance from policy inputs. While public opinion and attention can be connected to voting patterns, it is much more difficult to say how they affect the lawyers sitting at desks in the federal bureaucracy writing the minutiae of the law. The subsequent chapters of this dissertation take up the task of more directly linking policy change to public attention and expressed opinion through public pressure campaigns, congressional oversight, and social movements.</p>
<p>For this exercise, I use the Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. These data reflect the magnitude of different types of policymaking but not the direction. As the name suggests, many rules may be reversing a previous rule. However, it does indicate that attention and resources are being devoted to the policy area and thus that it is a salient issue for policymakers. Whether these policy issues align with the issues that are salient to the mass public and political elites is the subject of the present investigation.</p>
<p>These data were compiled from two sources published by the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Since the Reagan administration, agencies have been required to report their rulemaking activities for semi-annual publication in the Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. Separately, ORIA issues annual reports from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regarding the rules it has reviewed. OMB only reviews significant rulemakings (generally those with significant economic impact or affecting other areas of government), but their data helps correct reporting errors and gaps in the Unified Agenda, ensuring that at least significant rules are included and correctly dated. Together these sources yield a dataset of 56,304 unique rulemaking projects as identified by a Regulation Identification Number (RIN). RINs allow us to track a rule from the publication of a draft to the eventual publication of a final rule (or withdrawal).</p>
<p>Regulation Identification Numbers are allocated by agency, allowing me to disaggregate the OIRA reports by policy area. I generally followed the policy areas identified by the Policy Agendas Project (Baumgartner et al., 2016). The first two numbers of a RIN generally signify the department, and the next two, the bureau within the department. Many issue areas, like welfare and foreign affairs, cross multiple entire departments while others, like civil rights, are the domain of only a few sub-bureaus.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Scatterplots of Rulemaking</h3>
<p>In addition to histograms of the number of rules, we can see patterns in rulemaking by plotting the date a rule is finalized or withdrawn on a scatterplot. On the y-axis is the Regulation Identification Number (RIN). RIN numbers are assigned in temporal order within each bureau or sub-agency. For example, the lower half of <a href="macro.html#fig:macro-cms-scatter">1.2</a> shows a high and steady rate of rulemaking by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, and the upper half shows a very modest rate of rulemaking at the Social Security Administration until the passage of the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, which gave it a more prominent role in administering Medicare.</p>

<p>Other major political events can be seen in the scatterplots of agency rulemaking. For example, the gap in rulemaking activity between 1995-1996 reflects the government shutdown. We also see the abrupt end of agencies and departments, including those in the Department of Justice and Department of Transportation, reflecting their reorganization into the Department of Homeland Security after the attacks of September 11, 2001. This included the Coast Guard and Transportation Security Administration from the Department of Transportation and several agencies, including the Immigration and Naturalization Service from the Department of Justice (see scatterplots in the Appendix). <!--TODO--></p>
<p>There is a stark increase in the number of rules being withdrawn across policy areas beginning with the election of George W. Bush and continuing into the Obama administration. Withdrawals may indicate that the draft regulations started by the previous administration are being canceled, that new legislation is passed, or, more likely, that there is simply a more systematic practice of reporting withdrawals.</p>
<p>In any of these figures, one can observe the general rate of rulemaking in each bureau as the slope of the line of black squares. Points below the line are rules that took longer than usual to finalize. Thus, these figures allow us to see the relative rate of rule finalization and withdrawal as well as the variance in how long agency rules take to work through the policy process.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> The Likelihood of Rulemaking over Time</h3>
<p>Finally, we can estimate statistical trend lines for different policy types. While many statistical approaches may be appropriate, I opt to use a proportional hazard model. This method estimates a baseline hazard rate–the likelihood a rule will be published given the number of days since a draft was released. I then estimate the effect of calendar time on this baseline hazard rate. The effect of calendar time on the likelihood of rule finalization is fit using a smoothing spline for every two years (every Congress) in the dataset. These splines estimate a cubic polynomial function that best captures the effect of a given date on the likelihood of rulemaking over the spline interval (a Congress) while also smoothly connecting to the intervals on either side. This gives us a smoothed function estimating the likelihood of rulemaking over time (Figure <a href="macro.html#fig:macro-likelihood">1.3</a>).</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>By including the date that the draft rule was published, this approach captures two things not well-captured by histograms and scatterplots. First, it accounts for the pace of rulemaking (i.e., the time it takes from draft to completion). Second, it accounts for the likelihood that long-delayed rules will be finalized. Both of these indicate that the issue is politically salient. Compared to the raw number of rules finalized in a year, looking at the likelihood that a rule is finalized accounts for the denominator—the number of rules in progress and yet to be finalized in a given policy space.</p>
<p>Two notes are important for interpreting these figures. First, in 1994, President Clinton issued an executive order making only significant rules subject to ORIA review. Unfortunately, this coincides with the dramatic 1994 election that broke Democratic control of Congress, so inferences about this time are limited. It may be safest to assume that the universal dip in the likelihood of policymaking around 1994 is an artifact of this executive order and thus to imagine trend lines going forward from 1994 shifted up to have a mean of the value at 1994 to account for the increase in rules omitted from OIRA data. Second, this method is sensitive to outliers at the ends of the distribution. We should be especially cautious in making inferences from the first years that agencies were required to report these data as they may have been inconsistent. Thus, it is safest to look at the period between 1985 and 2015.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Policy Substance in Regulations</h2>
<p>This section presents selected figures and brief commentary on the extent to which patterns observed in rulemaking fit or conflict with those observed elsewhere in the American political system.</p>
<div id="social-policy-economic-policy-and-foreign-policy" class="section level3" number="1.5.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.1</span> Social Policy, Economic Policy, and Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>I start with the broadest categorizations of social policy and economic policy.
My social policy category is not equivalent to “social issues” as described by Shafer and Spady (2014) or Carmines, Ensley, and Wagner (2012). Social policy is also broader than welfare. I include not only Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and food and housing assistance but also public education, labor, and civil rights. More specifically, I combine the departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Labor, Veterans Affairs, and Justice, as well as the Social Security Administration, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, and a variety of other departments dealing with health, poverty, and civil rights.
My economic policy category includes the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, Energy, Transportation, Agriculture, and Interior.</p>
<p>The likelihood plots in Figure <a href="macro.html#fig:macro-social-econ">1.4</a> are not clear evidence for or against theories that suggest Democrats and Republicans should differ in their emphasis on these two broad categories. On the one hand, the patterns are not noticeably different before the 2000 election, and both George W. Bush and Barack Obama appear to have made more economic policy in their first term than in their second. On the other hand, there is a marked increase in the likelihood of social policy under the Obama administration, as suggested by the party ideology perspective put forward by Gerring (1998) and others. Social policy will be disaggregated to more specifically consider welfare, labor, and civil rights policymaking in the subsections below, but first, I turn to a third broad category of policymaking, foreign policy.</p>

<p>The histogram for foreign affairs (the Department of State and International Trade Administration) in Figure <a href="macro.html#fig:macro-foreign">1.5</a> differs from the Department of Defense, but the only clear pattern is the increased rulemaking after 1996, predating the dramatic increase in its budget after 2001 and significantly predating the 2004 election when Claggett and Shafer (2010) identify national security as emerging as an issue.
The likelihood plot suggests partisan effects with two peaks occurring during the 103rd and 111th Congresses, the only periods where Democrats had control of both houses and the presidency. This aligns with findings by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Farhang2016" role="doc-biblioref">Farhang and Yaver</a> (<a href="#ref-Farhang2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> that rulemaking is more likely to be concentrated in a single agency rather than fragmented across agencies under a unified government. There are smaller bumps that appear to correspond to the reelection of these two presidents when facing an oppositional Congress (but also no longer thinking about reelection).</p>

<p>A connection between labor and the Democratic party <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Schlozman2015" role="doc-biblioref">D. Schlozman 2015</a>)</span> is not obvious in the volume of Department of Labor regulations. If anything, Republican administrations seem to make more labor policy. Looking at the scatterplot in Figure <a href="macro.html#fig:macro-labor">1.6</a>, policymaking appears remarkably constant across sub-agencies within the Department of Labor, barring a marked pulse of rule withdrawals in 2001.</p>

<p>Clear peaks in welfare rulemaking (Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid) reflect the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act and the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The histogram in Figure <a href="macro.html#fig:macro-welfare">1.7</a> suggests that policymaking both increased and became more variable after 2000. This pattern is most consistent with Shafer’s characterization of the Era of Partisan Volatility. We do not see clear patterns associations with party balance, but this may be because we are looking at the amount of policy rather than its direction. The scatterplot shows significant numbers of rules withdrawn after 2001, which may indicate partisan disagreement.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.3</span> Civil Rights</h3>
<p>Among others, Mayhew (1991) and Claggett and Shafer (2010) identify civil rights as one of the major new issues on the post-war American policy agenda. Rulemaking, however, likely presents a poor measure of this policy issue, and classifying rules by agency only makes this problem worse. Only a few sub-agencies unambiguously address only civil rights issues. The figures below reflect the Department of Agriculture Office of Civil Rights, The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity bureau, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, none of which make many regulations. Little can be said about so little data, but rulemaking activity does appear to peak near the beginning of the Clinton administration and remain nearly non-existent since the beginning of the George W. Bush administration.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> It is possible that civil rights, anti-discrimination policy issues are meaningful for structuring votes and local policy but still poorly reflected in the volume of federal rules.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.4</span> Environment</h3>
<p>The cleanest way to capture environmental issues is to focus only on the Environmental Protection Agency. This is what the plots in Figure <a href="macro.html#fig:macro-environment">1.9</a>. However, environmental issues are also spread throughout the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, Defense, and, increasingly, state.
Claggett and Shafer (2010), among others, identify environmental issues as anomalous or off-dimension issues that may not cluster well with other issues. Shafer 2016 identifies environmental issues as a major policy issue until the 1990s. The rulemaking data in Figure <a href="macro.html#fig:macro-environment">1.9</a>, especially the histogram, do not contradict these interpretations. Unlike any other policy areas, the peak of environmental rules in this timeframe is when Reagan took office (probably capturing the end of the era of new landmark environmental legislation) and declines dramatically by the end of his term to a much lower level for the next three decades.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:macro-environment"></span>

</p>
</div>
<p>The likelihood plot in Figure <a href="macro.html#fig:macro-environment">1.9</a> does show peaks in the 103rd and 111th Congresses, suggesting partisan effects. However, this partisan association could be as much an artifact of the agency as the issue. For example, Republicans may be inclined to pursue environmental protection through the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, or Defense in which they may have more trust or better policy vehicles to serve their constituents (see Appendix for additional plots). Alternatively, policymaking in the EPA may be indicative of policymaking in other venues where Democrats may also pay more attention to environmental issues. Future research could analyze the abstracts of rules in more multi-issue agencies to better determine their content. The most pronounced peak may reflect Barack Obama’s executive actions in his second term (for example, his executive order on climate change adaptation (Obama 2013)).</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2" number="1.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>While this exercise did not reveal conclusive evidence regarding the patterns of U.S. policymaking, it
does offer some insights. First, welfare is one of the largest topics of executive policymaking, rivaled only
by defense. Both of these areas increased dramatically in volume and variability in what Shafer (2016)
calls the Era of Partisan Volatility. In contrast, civil rights and environmental policy have seen marked
decreases over the same period. In 1980, environmental policy was a top area of executive policymaking,
but it was overtaken by defense in 1996. Civil rights, where no year saw more than five rules by my
measure, raises the question of what it means for a major issue in mass politics to have few explicit
policies (at least within dedicated bureaus). Part of the story may well be that civil rights policy is being made in venues other than the federal agencies. Interestingly, Department of Labor policymaking
does not seem to have the partisan linkages one would suspect—another area where this exercise raises
questions for future research and theory.</p>
<!--
A major gap in the present analysis is my inability to address what have been called cultural issues or
behavioral norms–issues such as gender roles, abortion, and school prayer. One way to overcome this
gap would be to search for keywords in policies or their abstracts indicating that the policy addresses
behavioral norms.
-->
<p>Future research could also augment these data on regulations with data on agency budgets, which
may reveal different patterns and may better reflect the role of Congress in agencies’ policy agendas <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Judge-Lord2017" role="doc-biblioref">Judge-Lord 2017</a>)</span>. It should nevertheless be noted
that a great deal of spending is directed by rulemaking. Furthermore, rule publication dates may capture the timing of policy decisions better than other measures of policy priorities <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Potter2016" role="doc-biblioref">Potter 2017b</a>)</span>. Looking at budgets alone, as many scholars have done, risks attributing decisions made in the past to the politics of the present.
In the end, the relationships between rulemaking and the nature of change in public opinion and party power over time demands more detailed study. Linking macro-level politics to the
concrete substance of policy is not an easy task, but the fruits of such research are critical to understanding
which of American politics’ many moving parts most affect the concrete laws that govern daily life and, in many cases, feedback to reshape the terrain of American politics.</p>
<p>The following chapters in this dissertation focus on one narrow piece of this broad project to incorporate bureaucratic policymaking into theories of American politics. They use similar data but approach the problem from the other side. I start with theories of bureaucratic policymaking and begin to incorporate theories of civic engagement, pressure politics, legislative behavior, and social movement power in order to explain and account for the occasional bursts of public attention and engagement in agency rulemaking. In these policy fights, the politics of agency rulemaking begins to look more like the American politics described above—dominated by durable yet shifting coalitions of social movements, organized interests, politicians, and the attentive public.</p>
