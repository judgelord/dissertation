<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Do the issues that dominate political discourse translate into actual policy? To the extent that broad theories of American politics go beyond elections and attempt to explain the resulting policies, they generally focus on landmark legislation and items at the top of presidential agendas. Yet as the administrative state and our understanding of it have grown, political scientists are increasingly paying attention to policy outputs, both for their own sake and how policy outputs shape politics.</p>
<p>Agency rules and regulations are where the rubber hits the road for both legislation and presidential agendas <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Yackee2009bush" role="doc-biblioref">J. W. Yackee and Yackee 2009b</a>)</span>. Ninety percent of U.S. law is now written by agencies rather than Congress <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-West2013" role="doc-biblioref">West and Raso 2013</a>)</span>, and the real impact of most new statutes and executive orders is largely unknown until the ink is dry on the agency rules and regulations that implement them.
Legally binding regulations give specific meaning and force to legislation and presidential agendas.</p>
<p>As the substantive outputs of policy processes, if changes in public attention or opinion and elected leaders’ priorities matter for policy, we would expect to see these changes borne out in the number and type of agency rules published. Changes in outputs may reflect changes in the substantive inputs—“issue structure” and policy agendas—or changes in how issues are filtered and activated by the institutional structures of policymaking.</p>
<p>This chapter martials data on federal agency policymaking from 1981 to 2018 to sketch broad trends in federal policymaking. Broad theories of American politics suggest three types of predictions: (1) patterns in the substantive issues addressed by policy, (2) patterns in the relationship between partisan control and issue attention, and (3) patterns in the pace of policy change. The systematic data on agency rulemaking that I introduce here permit us to assess the extent to which broad theories of American politics align with the substance, volume, and timing of policy outputs.</p>
<p>This exercise has two purposes. First, I to introduce a large dataset on federal policymaking and situate these data in the broader context of American politics. These policies (federal agency rules) and their potential to change are the contexts for the political dynamics that I explore in Chapter <a href="whymail.html#whymail">2</a> and the dependent variable for Chapter <a href="influence.html#influence">3</a>. Thus, this chapter helps to show patterns of variation in the dependent variable (policy change) and puts it in a context broader than bureaucratic politics.</p>
<p>Second, I contrast the hard data with broad political science theories. This assessment is descriptive and intended to be provocative—an attempt to stretch the conceptual ground of theories of American politics to include a large volume of often-neglected policy outcomes. The extent to which the match between theory and data is unsatisfying may point toward opportunities for theorizing, a narrow portion of which I take up in the following chapters that focus squarely on expanding theories of bureaucratic policymaking.</p>
<p>My aim is to compare research on the social structure and political behavior of the American public and political elites with what government actually does. Agency rulemaking is driven in part by laws passed by Congress and in part by the president’s agenda. Discrepancies may indicate either a true disconnect between electoral politics and executive action or that executive policymaking was constrained by other political forces.
This chapter’s brief sketch of possible alignments and disconnects between theories of mass and party politics and bureaucratic politics aims to call scholars of public opinion and party politics to see rulemaking as a relevant dependent variable. Likewise, it is a call for bureaucratic politics scholars to consider how mass politics and social movements may impact the policy outcomes we study.</p>
<p>Connecting broad theories of the American political landscape to the nuanced daily actions of government is not easy. I focus on relatively fine-grain policy outputs, draft and final rules published by agencies in the Federal Register and reported to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. This approach has the advantage of capturing the making of law as it is, not how it is framed by elites or thought of by the electorate. The disadvantage is its distance from policy inputs. While public opinion and attention can be studied with surveys and connected to voting patterns, it is much more difficult to say how they affect the lawyers sitting at desks in the federal bureaucracy writing the minutiae of the law. The subsequent chapters of this dissertation take up the task of more directly linking policy change to public attention and expressed opinion through public pressure campaigns, congressional oversight, and social movements.</p>

<!-- > TODO: 
### The Policy Agenda

How congressional enacting legislation, president's priorities, and the bureaucracy's lag time in writing rules interface with these larger agenda issues.  Should we expect to see this type of direct translation into the agency's rulemaking production without congressional mediation?  Why or why not?  -->
<p>There are many causal pathways between public opinion or attention and policy outcomes. Most are long and complex. Before exploring the extent to which these shifts observed in public opinion polls and party agendas show up in policy outputs, I briefly review what we know about the pathways by which this may or may not occur.</p>

#### Policymaking Under Unified and Divided Government

#### Issue Ownership and the Politics of Attention-->
<p>Concerning the anticipated level of attention paid to different policy areas, theories of American politics that focus on policy substance can be lumped into two types: (1) those that generally predict that both parties pay attention to the same issues at the same time (theories of partisan alignment (e.g., Sundquist) and (2) those that generally predict that parties pay attention to different issues (including both theories of party ideologies <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Gerring1998" role="doc-biblioref">Gerring 1998</a>)</span> and theories of party coalitions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Schlozman2015" role="doc-biblioref">D. Schlozman 2015</a>)</span>. <!--In each case, the particular issues may vary more or less dramatically depending on how sharply one defines historical periods (compare the issue evolution perspectives [@Carmines1989] with critical elections perspectives [@Key1961]). Indeed as @Shafer2016 notes, some periods may end quickly and others slowly. Given the limited time period of this chapter, I focus on the dominant policy issues, their relationship to party control, and the pace of policymaking rather than the timing or pace of transition between periods. --></p>
<p>These two types of theories generate broadly contrasting predictions about what we expect the government to do under various configurations of party control.</p>
<p>If partisan alignment theories explain variation in agency rulemaking, we would expect to see agency policymaking dominated by the same major issues of the day under both parties. Parties may have opposite positions on these issues leading the agencies to be pulled in opposite directions by political leaders, but each agency’s set of dominant policy issues demanding attention will remain largely the same. Indeed, the push and pull should lead to sustained high volumes of policy, as each new presidential administration and Congress reverse policies made by their predators or by other branches. Occasionally, an agency with somewhat overlapping authority may be given control of a program taken from an adjacent agency. For example, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Carpenter2001" role="doc-biblioref">D. P. Carpenter</a> (<a href="#ref-Carpenter2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span> documents how the Forest Service was relocated from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior. Nevertheless, the level of attention and volume of policymaking across broad policy areas should be relatively similar under both parties.</p>
<p>In contrast, if theories of party ideologies and party coalitions explain variation in agency policymaking, party control should greatly affect which issues get attention the issues. Thus, partisan control should have a much larger effect on which agencies are making more policy. This may occur through positive agenda control that the president has to direct agency policymaking or negative agenda control through the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs review <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Haeder2015" role="doc-biblioref">Haeder and Yackee 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-Potter2016" role="doc-biblioref">Potter 2017b</a>)</span>. Negative agenda control is likely to dominate in Congress <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Lowande2021" role="doc-biblioref">Lowande and Potter</a> (<a href="#ref-Lowande2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>, but the threat of Congressional action may be sufficient to influence agency policymaking <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Potter2016" role="doc-biblioref">Potter 2017b</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="the-implications-of-partisan-alignment" class="section level4" number="1.2.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1.1</span> The Implications of Partisan Alignment</h4>
<p>Partisan alignment theories necessarily identify dominant issue dimensions where each party is doing the opposite of the other. In Sundquist’s model, realignment can occur slowly or rapidly, whereas Manza and Brooks emphasize how social structures, and thus issues, change slowly. However, almost all prominent alignment theories identify 1980 through 2020 as one period (indeed, most see 1936 as the critical election that has oriented the modern era). Thus instead of engaging realignment theories on the issue of realignment, I draw on them for the issues that they claim constitute the dimension of the current alignment. By these theories, the dimensions of substantive conflict and thus the distribution of agency policymaking should be relatively stable over the period I consider here.</p>
<p>Realignment theories suggest that certain policy areas consistently dominate all others and, while the direction of policy will likely change, the issues will vary little with changes in partisan control. Presidential transitions may be marked by withdrawal or reversal of policies made under the previous administration, and Congress may overturn agency rules. Still, the relevant agencies will be the same, generally those dealing with social welfare.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1.2</span> The Implications of Issue Ownership and Party Coalitions</h4>
<p>The second type of theory about the effects of party control focuses on the differences of party ideologies, and its predictions are less clear. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Gerring1998" role="doc-biblioref">Gerring</a> (<a href="#ref-Gerring1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span> identifies distinct and consistent ideologies in both parties. Rather than a dominant dimension of conflict where parties respond to each other (as in alignment theories) or an underlying dimension of issue structure <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="#ref-Claggett2010" role="doc-biblioref">Claggett and Shafer 2010</a>)</span>, for Gerring, party ideologies are the policy agendas of party elites. “Party constituencies were generally conservative forces, whereas party elites were the agents of change” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Gerring1998" role="doc-biblioref">Gerring 1998</a>, pg. 272)</span>.</p>
<p>In the current era, Gerring argues, Republicans are driven by Neoliberalism and Democrats by Universalism. Like others, Gerring sees social values (behavioral norms) playing a prominent role in Republican policy agendas from 1980 to when the book was published in 1996 (see pg. 277). Yet, he argues, the platform’s core was neo-liberal opposition to the welfare state and promotion of less regulated markets. In contrast, the Democratic platform in this period consistently emphasized broad unifying issues like Medicare and education. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Grossman2021" role="doc-biblioref">Grossmann, Mahmood, and Isaac</a> (<a href="#ref-Grossman2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> reach a similar conclusion: The Republican Party represents business interests while the Democratic Party represents middle-class opinions and advocacy groups. Theories of party ideologies and coalitions offer concrete predictions about the policy areas likely to receive attention under Democrats than Republicans.</p>
<p>Under theories emphasizing party ideologies and interests, the volume of policymaking at different agencies would often change substantially when a different party captures the presidency. Specifically, if <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Gerring1998" role="doc-biblioref">Gerring</a> (<a href="#ref-Gerring1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span> correctly identified the party ideologies of the current era, we would expect significantly more civil rights and welfare policymaking under Democratic administrations and more neoliberal economic policy under Republican administrations, especially when presidents’ co-partisans have majorities in Congress. Gerring’s distinction between Democrats’ statism and Republicans’ anti-statism may also suggest more rulemaking overall in Democrat administrations.</p>
<!--TODO This suggests two hypothesis 
Dems make more rules per year on average
republicans withdraw more rules when they take over
H3: Dems make more labor policy 
H4; republicans reverse dem labor policy 

donors, Selin ideology scores, etc
-->
<p>Theories that focus on interest groups and coalitions also suggest that issues will vary with party control. If parties contain coalitions of intense policy demanders <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Cohen2008" role="doc-biblioref">Cohen et al. 2008</a>; <a href="#ref-DiSalvo2012" role="doc-biblioref">DiSalvo 2012</a>)</span>, the issues to which they attend will reflect these different coalitions. Disalvo shares Gerring’s conclusion regarding the anti-statism of the Republican party. Most clearly, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Schlozman2015" role="doc-biblioref">D. Schlozman</a> (<a href="#ref-Schlozman2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> links Democratic politics and labor groups. While Schlozman emphasizes that labor groups frequently fall short of their goals within the Democratic coalition, no other group is a stronger anchor. We thus expect much more labor policy (e.g., from the Department of Labor) under Democratic administrations. As the interest groups Schlozman identifies, anchoring the Republican party are focused on behavioral norms. Because policy governing behavioral norms is less concentrated in certain agencies, we are less able to speculate on which agencies should do more policymaking under each party. Again, a president having co-partisans in Congress ought to increase these effects.</p>
<p>The theories discussed above all emphasize party difference, either on ideology (on the same issues for Sundquist, on different issues for Gerring) or anchoring interests. However, the observable implications are different for patterns of bureaucratic policymaking we should find. If party alignment theories explain policy outputs, the volume of agency rules will concentrate on the same salient issues and agencies, even as parties change. Here policymaking for both parties is driven by issues of the day and party conflict on these salient issues.
In contrast, if issue ownership and party coalition theories explain policy outputs, the volume of agency rules at different agencies should vary by partisan control.<br />
This is because party leaders care about and “own” different issues and constituencies that should lead them to emphasize different policy areas, not simply reversing course on the same policy area.
Specifically, Democrats should emphasize labor policy <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Schlozman2015" role="doc-biblioref">D. Schlozman 2015</a>)</span>, civil rights, and welfare policy more than Republicans. Republicans may emphasize market-making institutions.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Policymaking and Policy Outcomes On Different Issues</h3>
<p>While many theories of mass and party politics have implications for bureaucratic policymaking, many consider the period covered by my data (1980 to 2020) to be one period and thus do not offer predictions about variation in agency policymaking over this time period. However,
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Shafer2016" role="doc-biblioref">Shafer</a> (<a href="#ref-Shafer2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> observes two different patterns of congressional policymaking during this period: first, a pattern of consistent major policymaking prior to 1992 and then a pattern of punctuated equilibrium after 1992. To the extent that congressional policymaking drives rulemaking, such patterns of policymaking should be visible in patterns of rulemaking as well. Importantly, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Shafer2016" role="doc-biblioref">Shafer</a> (<a href="#ref-Shafer2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> does not only consider landmark policies as patterns of policymaking. The “Era of Divided Government” (1969-1992) saw a steady flow of major policies, especially regarding the economy and the environment, and was dominated by social welfare and cultural values and cross-partisan coalitions, suggesting that the volume of policy outputs should be concentrated on social policy and civil rights and be fairly consistent across configurations of party control.<br />
In contrast, the “Era of Partisan Volatility” (1992 through the present) is characterized by periods of policy stability and punctuation.</p>
<p>This chapter aims to assess the extent to which patterns of agency policymaking fit these patterns.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>
Schafer characterizes this era by long stretches of policy stasis punctuated by spikes of activity. If these broad patterns in congressional policymaking explain policy outputs in bureaucratic policymaking, we would expect to see a similar pattern of lulls and spikes in rulemaking. Furthermore, party control may lead to different types of policymaking moving together depending on partisan control. The observation of punctuated equilibrium in legislative policymaking could also suggest a pattern where, in the absence of new legislation, the president may have a larger effect over patterns of agency rulemaking.</p>
<p>Scholarship thus gives us predictions regarding the issues that dominate American politics and how party control will affect the translation of issues into policy. However, the two-fold space for disagreement raises a problem for studying policy outputs in the present analysis. If we do not see policymaking on an issue, it could be evidence that the issue was not as important as claimed or that the party in power deemphasized it. Only by assuming a certain issue structure or a certain theory of party effects could we say that an absence of policymaking supports one perspective or another regarding issues or institutional structure. The evidence is sufficient, however, to rule out some explanations. The remainder of the chapter focuses on consistencies and inconstancies between the evidence and theories.</p>

Drawing on public opinion polls and presidential platforms, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Claggett2010" role="doc-biblioref">Claggett and Shafer</a> (<a href="#ref-Claggett2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> distinguish four broad categories of political issues: welfare, international relations, civil rights, and cultural issues. These categories are constructed to have policy-relevant content. Still, they do not perfectly align with how the government is organized, limiting our ability to categorize agency rules by their conceptual scheme. Nevertheless, their findings regarding the issue structure of American politics have observable implications for the quantity and substance of federal rulemaking. I elaborate on these implications and then contrast them with rulemaking data in the following sections.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Claggett2010" role="doc-biblioref">Claggett and Shafer</a> (<a href="#ref-Claggett2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> find that National Security was a major issue in 1984 but then faded until it emerged as the dominant issue of the 2004 election.

<p>Welfare was also a top issue in 1984 but continued to be salient and the dominant issue in several subsequent elections. If politics affects the volume of policymaking, agency policymaking (e.g., the number of agency rules) should reflect this finding that social welfare is a major feature of American politics <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Sundquist1973" role="doc-biblioref">Sundquist 1973</a>; <a href="#ref-Claggett2010" role="doc-biblioref">Claggett and Shafer 2010</a>)</span>.

<p>In sum, if the issue structure of politics shapes policy, past scholarship suggests that social welfare should be the leading policy type over all periods and for both parties. Social welfare is identified as a dominant dimension of party alignment and issue structure in public opinion.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2" number="1.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Data</h2>
<p>To examine patterns in rulemaking across the federal government over multiple administrations, I compiled data from two sources published by the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). Since the Reagan administration, agencies have been required to report their rulemaking activities for semi-annual publication in the Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. Separately, ORIA issues annual reports from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regarding the rules it has reviewed. OMB only reviews significant rulemakings (generally those with significant economic impact or affecting other areas of government), but I use their data to correct reporting errors and gaps in the Unified Agenda, ensuring that at least significant rules are included and correctly dated. Together these sources yield a dataset of 61,971 unique rulemaking projects as identified by a Regulation Identification Number (RIN). RINs allow me to track a rule from the publication of a draft to the eventual publication of a final rule (or withdrawal).</p>
<p>Regulation Identification Numbers are allocated by the agency. I use this to disaggregate the OIRA reports by policy area. I generally followed the policy areas identified by the Policy Agendas Project <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Baumgartner1993" role="doc-biblioref">Baumgartner and Jones 1993</a>)</span>. The first two numbers of a RIN generally signify the department, and the next two, the bureau within the department. Many issue areas, like welfare and foreign affairs, cross multiple entire departments while others, like civil rights, are the domain of only a few sub-bureaus.</p>
<p>These data reflect the magnitude of different types of policymaking but not the direction. As the name suggests, many rules may be reversing a previous rule. However, it does indicate that attention and resources are being devoted to the policy area and thus that it is a salient issue for policymakers. Whether these policy issues align with the issues that are salient to the mass public and political elites is the subject of the present investigation.</p>
<!-- IMPORTANT 
> TODO: APA exempts foreign affairs and defense. Civil rights policy is often made in other ways.

</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level2" number="1.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Methods</h2>
<p>To assess the relationship between partisan control and rulemaking outcomes, I visually present a count of the number of proposed and rules alongside a plot of partisan control. The top part of Figure <a href="macro.html#fig:ua-all">1.1</a> shows the approximate number of rules proposed, published, and withdrawn each year by Regulation ID Number.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>
The number of Final Rules is greater than the number of proposed rules for several reasons. First, there is selection bias in what is reported to OIRA. Some rules are only deemed significant after the proposed rule has been revised. Finally, some rules are published without a draft being published—often as an Interim Final Rule. Interim Final Rules are counted as Final Rules because they similarly reflect an agency’s policy priorities and efforts.
The bottom half shows partisan control of the presidency and each chamber of Congress over the same time period.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="macro.html#fig:ua-all">1.1</a> shows the level of rulemaking activity over time. Rules are tallied by year (the x-axis). The y-axis is the total number of published or withdrawn rules as reported in the Unified Agenda or by OIRA. There are between approximately 1500 and 4000 rulemaking projects across the federal government each year. While there is significant variation, the overall average is neither increasing nor decreasing dramatically. Several years are affected by data that is either missing (the 2004 data file is corrupted) or influenced by changes in reporting requirements (1994), but these figures still reveal broad trends in policymaking.</p>
<p>On net, there is little relationship with partisan control. However, there are notable spikes in rule withdrawal in 2001 and 2007 as new Republican presidents came in. Interestingly, there is no comparable spike in withdrawals when the Obama administration came in.</p>

<!--
### Scatterplots of Rulemaking

In addition to histograms of the number of rules, we can see patterns in rulemaking by plotting the date a rule is finalized or withdrawn on a scatterplot. On the y-axis is the Regulation Identification Number (RIN). RIN numbers are assigned in temporal order within each bureau or sub-agency. For example, the lower half of \@ref(fig:macro-cms-scatter) shows a high and steady rate of rulemaking by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, and the upper half shows a very modest rate of rulemaking at the Social Security Administration until the passage of the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, which gave it a more prominent role in administering Medicare.


-->
<!--
Other major political events can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:ua-all). For example, the gap in rulemaking activity between 1995-1996 reflects the government shutdown. 
<!--We also see the abrupt end of agencies and departments, including those in the Department of Justice and Department of Transportation, reflecting their reorganization into the Department of Homeland Security after the attacks of September 11, 2001. This included the Coast Guard and Transportation Security Administration from the Department of Transportation and several agencies, including the Immigration and Naturalization Service from the Department of Justice (see scatterplots in the Appendix). <!--TODO-->
<p>There is a stark increase in the number of rules being withdrawn across policy areas, beginning with the election of George W. Bush and continuing into the Obama and Trump administrations. Withdrawals may indicate that the draft regulations started by the previous administration are being canceled, that new legislation is passed. In these data, however, this sudden change is simply the beginning of a more systematic practice of reporting withdrawals.</p>
<!--
In any of these figures, one can observe the general rate of rulemaking in each bureau as the slope of the line of black squares. Points below the line are rules that took longer than usual to finalize. Thus, these figures allow us to see the relative rate of rule finalization and withdrawal as well as the variance in how long agency rules take to work through the policy process. 

### The Likelihood of Rulemaking over Time

Finally, we can estimate statistical trend lines for different policy types. While many statistical approaches may be appropriate, I opt to use a proportional hazard model. This method estimates a baseline hazard rate–the likelihood a rule will be published given the number of days since a draft was released. I then estimate the effect of calendar time on this baseline hazard rate. The effect of calendar time on the likelihood of rule finalization is fit using a smoothing spline for every two years (every Congress) in the dataset. These splines estimate a cubic polynomial function that best captures the effect of a given date on the likelihood of rulemaking over the spline interval (a Congress) while also smoothly connecting to the intervals on either side. This gives us a smoothed function estimating the likelihood of rulemaking over time (Figure \@ref(fig:macro-likelihood)). 

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="Figs/todo.png" alt="Smoothed Likelihood that a Rule is Published on a Given Day 1981-2018" width="100%"  />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:macro-likelihood)Smoothed Likelihood that a Rule is Published on a Given Day 1981-2018</p>
</div>

By including the date that the draft rule was published, this approach captures two things not well-captured by histograms and scatterplots. First, it accounts for the pace of rulemaking (i.e., the time it takes from draft to completion). Second, it accounts for the likelihood that long-delayed rules will be finalized. Both of these indicate that the issue is politically salient. Compared to the raw number of rules finalized in a year, looking at the likelihood that a rule is finalized accounts for the denominator---the number of rules in progress and yet to be finalized in a given policy space.
-->
<p>Two notes are important for interpreting these figures. First, in 1994, President Clinton issued an executive order making only significant rules subject to ORIA review. Unfortunately, this coincides with the dramatic 1994 election that broke Democratic control of Congress, so inferences about this time are limited. It may be safest to assume that any dip in policymaking around 1994 is an artifact of this executive order and the increase in rules omitted from OIRA data. Second, we should be especially cautious in making inferences from the first years that agencies were required to report these data as they may have been inconsistent. Thus, it is safest to look at the period after 1985.</p>

More specifically, I combine the departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Labor, Veterans Affairs, and Justice, as well as the Social Security Administration, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, and a variety of other departments dealing with health, poverty, and civil rights.

 First, I turn to a third broad category of policymaking, foreign policy. 



The number of foreign affairs (the Department of State, Department of Defense, and International Trade Administration) in Figure \@ref(fig:macro-foreign) differs from the Department of Defense, but the only clear pattern is the increased rulemaking after 1996, predating the dramatic increase in its budget after 2001 and significantly predating the 2004 election when Claggett and Shafer (2010) identify national security as emerging as an issue. 

There is a spike in rulemaking at the department of state. This aligns with findings by @Farhang2016 that rulemaking is more likely to be concentrated in a single agency rather than fragmented across agencies under a unified government. There are smaller bumps that appear to correspond to the reelection of these two presidents when facing an oppositional Congress (but also no longer thinking about reelection).

<p>Clear peaks in welfare rulemaking (Led by Department of Health and Human Services agencies that administer Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid) reflect the policymaking after the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act and the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The histogram in Figure <a href="macro.html#fig:macro-welfare">1.4</a> suggests that policymaking both increased and became more variable from 2003 onwards. This pattern is most consistent with Shafer’s characterization of the Era of Partisan Volatility. We do not see clear patterns of rulemaking associated with party balance, but this may be because we are looking at the amount of policy rather than its direction. Many of the rules in the departments included in <a href="macro.html#fig:macro-welfare">1.4</a> are reversing the previous president’s policies. For example, this category includes the Obama and Trump administration’s immigration policies.</p>

### Civil Rights

Among others, @Mayhew2000 identifies civil rights as one of the major new issues on the post-war American policy agenda. Rulemaking, however,  presents a poor measure of this policy issue. Classifying rules by agency only makes this problem worse. Only a few sub-agencies unambiguously address only civil rights issues. The figures below reflect the Department of Agriculture Office of Civil Rights, The Department of Housing and Urban Development's Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity bureau, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, none of which make many regulations. Little can be said about so little data, but rulemaking activity does appear to peak near the beginning of the Clinton administration and remain nearly non-existent since the beginning of the George W. Bush administration.^[Future research could search for additional activity using keywords in rule abstracts.] It is possible that civil rights, anti-discrimination policy issues are meaningful for structuring votes and local policy but still poorly reflected in the volume of federal rules.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.3</span> Environment</h3>
<p>The cleanest way to capture environmental issues is to focus only on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
However, environmental issues are also spread throughout the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, Defense, and, increasingly, the Department of State.
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Claggett2010" role="doc-biblioref">Claggett and Shafer</a> (<a href="#ref-Claggett2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>, among others, identify environmental issues as anomalous or off-dimension issues that may not cluster well with other issues. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Shafer2016" role="doc-biblioref">Shafer</a> (<a href="#ref-Shafer2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> identifies environmental issues as a major policy issue until the 1990s. The patterns of EPA in Figure <a href="macro.html#fig:ua-Environmental">1.5</a> do not contradict these interpretations. More than any other policy area, the peak of environmental rules in this timeframe is when Reagan took office in 1981. This peak may reflect Reagan’s ambitious efforts to reshape the EPA and decline dramatically by the end of his term to a much lower level for the next three decades. The peak in EPA rulemaking may also reflect the tail end of the era of new landmark environmental legislation.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>While this exercise did not reveal conclusive evidence regarding the patterns of U.S. policymaking, it
does offer some insights. First, there is surprisingly little variation across presidents and periods of divided or unified government. While more robust research designs find effects <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-PotterShipan2019" role="doc-biblioref">Potter and Shipan</a> (<a href="#ref-PotterShipan2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, they are not obvious from the volume of rulemaking alone.</p>
<p>There are some partisan differences.
Presidents G.W. Bush and Trump withdrew many more of their predecessors’ policies in their first year in office than President Obama did. While there a large number of withdrawals at the Department of Justice, Department of Interior, and EPA, the largest scale reversal for both Republican presidents was at the Department of Labor. Interestingly, the Obama Administration appears to have withdrawn very few of its predecessor’s policies. Some policy areas also seem largely immune from the wave of withdrawals that come with a new president. The Departments of Education, Commerce, Treasury, and Energy, as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, barely registered an increase in withdrawals as new presidential administrations came in.</p>
<p>Events of the day also translate into rulemaking. There are observable bursts of rulemaking following several landmark pieces of legislation and government reorganization following the 9/11/2001 terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>There is also some evidence that political attention (or, perhaps, modes of policymaking) change systematically over time.
The volume of policy at the Departments of State, Defense, and Energy increased fairly consistently while the volume of policy at the Departments of Agricultural and Education declined over the same period. In 1981, the EPA was one of the most prolific policymaking institutions before declining dramatically.

A major gap in the present analysis is my inability to address what have been called cultural issues or
behavioral norms–issues such as gender roles, abortion, and school prayer. One way to overcome this
gap would be to search for keywords in policies or their abstracts indicating that the policy addresses
behavioral norms.
--></p>
<p>Future research could also augment these data on regulations with data on agency budgets, which
may reveal different patterns and may better reflect the role of Congress in agencies’ policy agendas <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Judge-Lord2017" role="doc-biblioref">Judge-Lord 2017</a>)</span>. It should nevertheless be noted
that a great deal of spending is directed by rulemaking. Furthermore, rule publication dates may capture the timing of policy decisions better than other measures of policy priorities <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Potter2016" role="doc-biblioref">Potter 2017b</a>)</span>. Looking at budgets alone, as many scholars have done, risks attributing decisions made in the past to the politics of the present.
In the end, the relationships between rulemaking and the nature of change in public opinion and party power over time demands more detailed study. Linking macro-level politics to the concrete substance of policy is not an easy task, but the fruits of such research are critical to understanding
which of American politics’ many moving parts most affect the concrete laws that govern daily life and, in many cases, feedback to reshape the terrain of American politics.</p>
<p>The following chapters in this dissertation focus on one narrow piece of this broad project to better integrate bureaucratic policymaking into theories of American politics. They use similar data but approach the problem from the other side. I start with theories of bureaucratic policymaking and begin to incorporate theories of civic engagement, pressure politics, legislative behavior, and social movement power in order to explain and account for the occasional bursts of public attention and engagement in agency rulemaking. In these policy fights, the politics of agency rulemaking begins to look more like the American politics described above—dominated by durable yet shifting coalitions of social movements, organized interests, politicians, and the attentive public.</p>
