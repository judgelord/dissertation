<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>I assess whether public pressure campaigns increase lobbying success in agency rulemaking using a mix of hand-coding and computational text analysis methods. To measure lobbying success, I develop computational methods to identify lobbying coalitions and estimate lobbying success for all rules posted for comment on regulations.gov. These methods are validated against a random sample of 100 rules with a mass-comment campaign and 100 rules without a mass comment campaign that I hand-code for whether each coalition got the policy outcome they sought. I then assess potential mechanisms by which mass public engagement may affect policy. Each mechanism involves a distinct type of information revealed to decisionmakers. Of primary interest is the extent to which public pressure campaigns affect agency decisionmakers directly or indirectly through their effects on elected officials’ oversight behaviors. I test this by assessing congressional oversight as a causal mediator using a subset of rules where I collect and code correspondence from Member of Congress to agencies about proposed agency rules.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> See the preanalysis plan for this chapter <a href="https://github.com/judgelord/dissertation/blob/master/04-influence/preanalysis.pdf"><em>here</em></a>.</h2>

<!--To address this gap, -->
<p>I assess the relationship between the number of
public comments and the amount of change between draft and final policy
texts. Next, I assess the relationship between the number of people
mobilized by each campaign and whether the campaign achieved its policy
goals. Finally, I theorize and test four mechanisms by which public
input may affect bureaucratic policymaking. Each mechanism involves a
distinct type of information that pressure campaigns may relay to
policymakers: technical information, information about the likelihood of
political consequences, information about the preferences of elected
officials, or information about the preferences of the attentive public.
Because scholarship on bureaucratic policymaking has focused on the
power of technical information, where insider lobbying is most likely to
matter and where outside strategies are least likely to matter,
political scientists have largely overlooked mass mobilization as a
tactic.</p>
<p>I find evidence consistent with the observable implications of mass
comment campaigns influencing policymaking through <span class="math display">\[non-null results\]</span>
but no evidence that mass engagement affects rulemaking processes or
outcomes through <span class="math display">\[null results\]</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2" number="4.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Data</h2>
<p>I create an original dataset that combines several sources of data on U.S. federal agency rulemaking.
The core data are the texts of draft and final rules and public comments on these proposed rules.
This includes all 16 thousand proposed rules from 144 agencies (as defined by regulations.gov) that were open for comment on regulations.gov between 2005 and 2018, that received at least one comment from an organization, and that saw a final agency action between 2005 and 2019.
There are over 50 million comments on this set of rules.
I scrape draft and final rule texts from federalregister.gov and comments submitted as attachments or by mail from regulations.gov.
I retrieve comments submitted directly on regulations.gov and metadata on rules and comments (such as the dates that the proposed rule was open for comment and whether the agency identified the organization submitting the comment) from the regulations.gov API.
I add additional metadata on rules (such as whether the rule was considered “significant”) from the Unified Agenda published by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (reginfo.gov).</p>
<p>Finally, to better capture positions expressed by Members of Congress on proposed rules, I supplement congressional comments posted on regulations.gov with Freedom of Information Act Requests for all communication from Members of Congress to each agency on proposed rules from 2007 to 2019.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The combined dataset has over 50 million observations of one public or legislator comment on a proposed rule. I attempt to identify the organization(s) that submitted or mobilized each comment by extracting all organization names from the comment text. For comments that do not reference an organization, I am often able to identify organizations with an internet search using the comment’s text. I then identify lobbying coalitions by clustering comments that use similar phrases or word frequencies. Co-signed comments are always assigned to the same coalition. Likewise, form-letter comments are always assigned to the same coalition.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Because my hypotheses are about the influence of organizations and coalitions, for analysis, I collapse these data to one observation per organization or coalition per proposed rule and identify the main substantive comment submitted by each organization’s staff or lawyers, which are usually much longer than supporting comments like form letters. For hand-coding, I first select a random sample of 100 proposed rules with a mass-comment campaign and then selecting a matched sample of 100 proposed rules without a mass comment campaign. Matching prioritizes, presidential administration, policy area (following Policy Agendas Project coding), rule significance, department, agency, subagency, and proposed rule length, respectively.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This hand-coded sample is several times larger than leading studies using hand-coding and includes rules with very large and small numbers of comments that previous studies exclude. The full sample is four hundred times larger.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level2" number="4.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Methods</h2>
<p>The most direct way to assess the hypothesis that mass engagement increases lobbying success is to assess the magnitude of the relationship between the number of comments that a coalition mobilizes and its lobbying success. However, public pressure campaigns may only be effective under certain conditions. Thus, I first assess the main relationship and then assess evidence for or against different potential causal pathways of influence.</p>
<div id="the-dependent-variable-lobbying-success" class="section level3" number="4.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> The Dependent Variable: Lobbying Success</h3>
<p>The dependent variable is the extent to which a lobbying coalition got the policy outcome they sought, which I measure in three ways.</p>
<p>First, on a sample of rules, I hand-code lobbying success for each lobbying coalition, comparing the change between the draft and final rule to each organization’s demands on a five-point scale from “mostly as requested” to “significantly different/opposite than requested.”
To do this, I first identify organizational comments.
For each organization, I identify the main overall demand and the top three specific demands and the corresponding parts of the draft and final rule texts.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><br />
I then code overall lobbying success and lobbying success on each specific demand for each organization and coalition. Both the overall score and average score across specific demands both fall on the interval from -1 (“significantly different”) to 1 (“mostly as requested”).</p>
<p>Second, I use methods similar to automated plagiarism detection algorithms to identify changes between a draft and final rule that were suggested in a comment. Specifically, I count the number of words in phrases of at least ten words that appear in the comment and final rule, but not the draft rule. To do this, I first identify new or changed text in the final rule by removing all 10-word or longer phrases retained from the draft rule. I then search each comment for any 10-word or longer phrases shared with the new rule text and count the total number of shared words in these shared phrases. Finally, I normalize this count of “copied” words across shorter and longer comments by dividing it by the total number of words in the comment. This measure falls between 0 (zero percent of words from the comment added to the final rule) and 1 (100 percent of words from the comment added to the final rule). As a robustness check, I also use the non-normalized version of this variable, i.e. the raw number of “copied” words.</p>
<p>Third, I capture a broader dimension of lobbying success by modeling the similarity in word frequency distributions between comments and changes to the rule. New or changed text is identified as described above, except that I also include the rule’s preamble and the agency’s responses to comments. Agencies write lengthy justifications of their decisions in response to some comments but not others. By including preambles and responses to comments, this measure captures attention to a comment’s demands and the extent to which the agency adopts a comment’s discursive framing (i.e. the distribution of words it uses). I us cosign similarity to scale the word frequencies used by each comment relative to those in changes between draft and final rule.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This measure falls between 0 (no common words) and 1 (exactly the same distribution of words).</p>
<p>To assess the performance of these automated methods (text-reuse and word-frequency similarity), I calculate the correlation between these scores and my hand-coded 5-point scale for rules in the hand-coded sample where a final rule was published. As the automated methods apply at the organization-level, coalition scores are those from the lead organization–by default, the organization(s) with the longest comment. At the coalition level, the correlation between hand-coded influence is __ with the text-reuse method and __ with the word-frequency method.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-main-predictor-variable" class="section level3" number="4.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> The Main Predictor Variable</h3>
<p>The number of supportive comments generated by a public pressure campaign (the main variable of interest) is a tally of all comments mobilized by each organization or coalition that ran a mass-comment campaign on a proposed rule. Because the marginal impact of additional comments likely diminishes, the number of comments is logged. This does not include the main substantive comments submitted by an organization’s staff or lawyers. Nor does it include comments that are not affiliated with the organization or coalition. If an organization mobilizes more than 1000 comments or 100 identical comments on a proposed rule, I code that organization, its coalition, and the proposed rule as having a mass comment campaign. Where organizational comments are not supported by a mass comment campaign <em>log mass comments</em> takes a value of 0.</p>
</div>
<div id="explanatory-variables" class="section level3" number="4.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3</span> Explanatory variables</h3>
<p>Other predictors of lobbying success in the models below are the length of the (lead) organization’s comment, whether the coalition lobbies unopposed, the size of the lobbying coalition, and whether the coalition is business-led. <em>Comment length</em> is normalized by dividing the number of words in the comment by the number of words in the proposed rule, thus capturing the complexity of the comment relative to the complexity of the proposed rule. The number and type(s) of organization(s) is an attribute of each coalition (e.g. a <em>business-led</em> coalition with <em>N</em> organizational members). Coalition <em>size</em> is the number of distinct commenting organizations in the coalition (including those that co-sign a comment). For organizations lobbying alone, coalition <em>size</em> is 1. A coalition is <em>unopposed</em> when no opposing organizations comments. I code a coalition as <em>business-led</em> if the majority of commenting organizations are for-profit businesses, or if upon investigation, I find it to be primarily led or sponsored by for-profit businesses.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level3" number="4.3.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.4</span> Limitations</h3>
<p>The two main limitations of this design both bias estimates of public pressure campaign influence toward zero.</p>
<p>First, lobbying success may take forms other than changes in policy texts. Agencies may speed up or delay finalizing a rule, extend the comment period, or delay the date at which the rule goes into effect. Indeed, commentors often request speedy or delayed rule finalization, comment period extensions, or delayed effective dates. I capture these potential outcomes in my hand-coding but not in the two automated methods, which apply only to observations with a final rule text. Likewise, there there is no change between draft and final rule, both automated methods necessarily record lobbying success as 0, even if a comment asks an agency to publish a rule without change.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Second, bureaucrats may anticipate public pressure campaigns when writing draft rules, muting the observed relationship between public pressure and rule change at the final rule stage of the policy process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="modeling-the-direct-relationship" class="section level2" number="4.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Modeling the direct relationship</h2>
<p>For all three measures of lobbying success, I assess the relationship between lobbying success and mass comments by modeling coalition <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s lobbying success, <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> as a combination of the relative length of the (lead) organizations comment, whether the coalition is unopposed, the coalition’s size, whether it is a business coalition, and the logged number of mass comments. I estimate OLS<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> regression:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 log(comments_i) + \beta_2 length_i + \beta_3 unopposed_i + \beta_4 size_i + \beta_5 business_i + \epsilon_i
\]</span></p>
<div id="modeling-mediated-relationships" class="section level3" number="4.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Modeling mediated relationships</h3>
<p>To estimate mediated effects, I estimate the average conditional marginal effect (ACME) and the proportion of the total effect attributed to mediation through congressional support (comments or other communication from Members of Congress supporting the coalition’s position on the proposed rule). As developed by Imai et al. (2010), this involves first estimating a model of the proposed mediator as a combination of covariates, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> (<em>length</em>, <em>unopposed</em>, <em>size</em>, and <em>business</em>) and then the outcome as a combination of the mediator, <em>congressional support</em>, and covariates, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>Mediator model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
congressional\ support_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 log(comments_i) + \beta_{2-n} X_i + \epsilon_i
\]</span></p>
<p>Outcome model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Examples of hand-coded lobbying success</h2>
<p><strong>2015 Waters of the United States Rule:</strong>
In response to litigation over which waters were protected by the Clean Water Act, the Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corp of Engineers proposed a rule based on a legal theory articulated by Justice Kennedy, which was more expansive than Justice Scalia’s.
The Natural Resources Defense Council submitted a 69-page highly technical comment “on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council…, the Sierra Club, the Conservation Law Foundation, the League of Conservation Voters, Clean Water Action, and Environment America” supporting the proposed rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“we strongly support EPA’s and the Corps’ efforts to clarify which waters are protected by the Clean Water Act. We urge the agencies to strengthen the proposal and move quickly to finalize it…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I coded this as support for the rule change, specifically not going far enough. I also coded it as requesting speedy publication. NRDC makes four substantive requests: one about retaining language in the proposed rule (“proposed protections for tributaries and adjacent waters…must be included in the final rule”) and three proposed changes (“we describe three key aspects of the rule that must be strengthened”).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> These demands provide specific keywords and phrases for which to search in the draft and final rule text.</p>
<p>A coalition of 15 environmental organizations mobilized over 944,000 comments, over half (518,963) were mobilized by the four above organizations: 2421,641 by Environment America, 108,076 by NRDC, 101,496 by clean water action, and 67,750 by the Sierra Club. Other coalition partners included EarthJustice (99,973 comments) and Organizing for Action (formerly president Obama’s campaign organization, 69,369 comments). This is the upper tail end of the distribution. This coalition made sophisticated recommendations and mobilized a million people.</p>
<p>The final rule moved in the direction requested by NRDC’s coalition, but to a lesser extent than requested–what I code as “some desired changs.”" As NRDC et al. requested, the final rule retained the language protecting tributaries and adjacent waters and added some protections for “other waters” like prairie potholes and vernal pools, but EPA did not alter the exemptions for ditches and waste treatment systems.</p>
<p>Comparing the draft and final with text reuse allows us to count the number words that belong to 10-word phrases that appear in both the draft and final, those that appear only in the draft, and those that appear only in the final. For the 2015 Waters Of The U.S. rule, 15 thousand words were deleted, 37 thousand words were added, and 22 thousand words were kept the same. This means that more words “changed” than remained the same, specifically 69% of words appearing in the draft or final were part were either deleted or added.</p>
<p>For this coalition, the dependent variable, <em>coalitions success</em> is 1, <em>coalition size</em> is 15, <em>business coalition</em> is 0, <em>comment length</em> is 69/88, 0.78, and <em>log mass comments</em> is log(943,931), 13.76.</p>
<p><strong>2009 Fine Particle National Ambient Air Quality Standards:</strong> In 2008, the EPA proposed a rule expanding air quality protections. Because measuring small particles of air pollution was once difficult, measurements of large particulates were allowed as a surrogate measure for fine particles under EPA’s 1977 PM10 Surrogate Policy. EPA proposed eliminating this policy, thus requiring regulated entities and state regulators to measure and enforce limits on much finer particles of air pollution.</p>
<p>EPA received 163 comments on the rule, 129 from businesses, business associations such as the American Petroleum Institute and The Chamber of Commerce, and state regulators that opposed the rule. Most of these were short and cited their support for the 63-page comment from the PM Group, “an ad hoc group of industry trade associations” that opposed the regulation of fine particulate matter. Six state regulators, including Oregon’s, only requested delayed implication of the rule until they next revised their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD). EarthJustice supported the rule but opposed the idea that the cost of measuring fine particles should be a consideration. On behalf of the Sierra Club, the Clean Air Task Force, EarthJustice commented: “We support EPA’s proposal to get rid of the policy but reject the line of questioning as to the benefits and costs associated with ending a policy that is illegal.” The EarthJustice-led coalition also opposed delaying implementation: “EPA must immediately end any use of the Surrogate Policy – either by”grandfathered" sources or sources in states with SIP‐approved PSD programs – and may not consider whether some flexibility or transition is warranted by policy considerations."</p>
<p>The final rule did eliminate the Surrate Policy but allowed states to delay implementation and enforcement until the next scheduled revision of their Implementation Plans. I code this as the EarthJustice coalition getting most of what they requested, but not a complete loss for the regulated coalition.</p>
<p>For the PM Group coalition, the dependent variable, <em>coalitions success</em> is -1, <em>coalition size</em> is 129, <em>business coalition</em> is 1, <em>comment length</em> is 63/85, 0.74, and <em>log mass comments</em> is 0.</p>
<p>For the State of Oregon’s coalition, the dependent variable, <em>coalitions success</em> is 2, <em>coalition size</em> is 6, <em>business coalition</em> is 0, <em>comment length</em> is 5/85, 0.06, and <em>log mass comments</em> is 0.</p>
<p>For the EarthJustice coalition, the dependent variable, <em>coalitions success</em> is 1, <em>coalition size</em> is 3, <em>business coalition</em> is 0, <em>comment length</em> is 7/85, 0.08, and <em>log mass comments</em> is 0.</p>

<li id="fn11"><p>Time allowing, I will hand-code a larger sample of proposed rules where no final rule was published so that these cases can be included in the analysis.
