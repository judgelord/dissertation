On the Negro protest movement there are many hypotheses but few attempts to relate them to differences in individual behavior.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Understanding of the phenomenon of political protest has been inhibited by the view that protest is fundamentally extraordinary or unconventional in character and that those who use it do so because they lack the resources to employ more conventional means of political expression. This article challenges this unqualified view by examining survey data based on black and white samples from the city of Milwaukee which relate to racial attitudes toward protest, the social characteristics of protest participants, and to the uses and organization of protest in the two racial communities. The analysis reveals widespread support for protest in the black community in contrast to the general antipathy found among whites. Both black and white protesters are found to be socioeconomically better-off than nonprotesters in their respective racial communities, but a variety of indicators suggest that black protesters are more integrated and typical members of their community than white protesters are of theirs. Data on the uses and organization of protest show that it has become an institutionalized feature of the black pursuit of urban politics in Milwaukee in contrast to its generally ad hoc and less frequent role for whites.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@unpublished{Carpenter,
abstract = {The petition is one of the most consequential institutions of republican government. Yet
considerable historical evidence suggests that petitions are routinely ignored by the legislatures and
executives who receive them, raising the question of why petitioning flourishes when the credibility
and authority of the petition is often minimal. In this speculative essay I interpret the petition as the
historical solution to a recruitment problem faced by activists building new political organizations in
network-rich but information-poor environments. Essentially, the list of signa tories accompanying a
petition is a rich political resource. For the recruiter, the petition's signatory list (1) identifies
individuals sympathetic to its prayer, (2) locates those individuals (implicitly or explicitly) in a social
structure, and (3) fosters new networks in the process of gathering signatures. For the citizen, the
list indicates who and how many have assented to the petition's prayer. I assess this account of the
petition in an analysis of a sample of 3,915 antislavery petitions to the House of Representatives
from the 25th Congress (1837-1839). Several stylized features of these petitions – repeat signatories,
the abundance of non-voting signatories, the preponderance of door-to-door canvassing, copied
signatures, and the transmission of petitions to legislators out of the petitioners' district – cohere
roughly with a mobilizing interpretation. I also present preliminary evidence that the cross-county
distribution of 1830s petitions from New York anticipates (1) the growth of American Anti-Slavery
Society chapters and (2) antislavery party voting in the 1840s in a way that other variables cannot.
The essay concludes that the abolitionists' petition drive was as much a method of mobilization as
an expression of public sentiment. My interpretation suggests that the most important readers of a
petition are its signatories, and raises the possibility that the petition can be politically consequential
even when it is known to be ignored by its intended recipient.},

@article{Walters2019a,
abstract = { outside interests shape the rulemaking agenda. A great deal of skepticism toward regulation stems from the widespread perception that agencies excessively, or even exclusively, cater
to business interests. One answer to these concerns is administrative procedure, in particular
rulemaking petitions, which are provided for in the Administrative Procedure Act and in
many substantive environmental statutes. Although rulemaking petitions could in theory be
used by business interests to strengthen their hold on regulatory agenda-setting, a growing
number of scholars, highlighting the critical role a rulemaking petition played in the Supreme
Court's 2007 decision forcing EPA action on climate change, have pointed to the potential for
rulemaking petitions to combat agency inaction and under-regulation. Despite these warring
descriptions, we actually have very little generalizable understanding of how rulemaking petitions operate in practice and to whom the benefits of the institution flow.
In this Article, I take a close look at original data on all the rulemaking petitions submitted to three administrative agencies from 2000 to 2016, statistically tracing petitions' fates
from submission to resolution. I find that, although business interests may participate at a
higher rate than public interest groups and individuals, there is little evidence of full-on regulatory capture via petitions. Even in a venue where it would be exceedingly easy to give
business interests precisely what they want, agencies remain largely unmoved and evenhanded. The pattern that does emerge—an agency preference for using petitions to inform
incremental revision and softening of existing regulations to reflect changed circumstances or
new technologies—probably does inure mostly to the benefit of regulated entities, but it is
difficult to square these findings with theories of excessive influence or capture of the regulatory
process by business interests. At the same time, the findings pour cold water on the more
sanguine account of petitions as a tool to advance environmental regulation. Despite the allure
of such an account after Massachusetts v. EPA, the reality is that petitions are rarely transformative and will remain so unless significant changes are made to the institution.},

abstract = {An increasing number of states have adopted laws that require voters to show photo identification to vote. We show that the deterrent effect of strict ID laws on turnout persists even after the laws are repealed. To assess the persistent effect of ID laws on turnout we leverage administrative data from North Carolina and a photo ID law that was in effect for a primary election, but not the subsequent general election. Using exact matching and a difference-indifferences design, we show that the photo ID law caused a 1 percentage point turnout decrease for voters without a North Carolina ID law in the primary election. After the law was suspended this effect persisted: those without an ID were 2.6 percentage points less likely to turnout in the general election. The general election effect is robust to a variety of alternative explanations and we show is consistent with aggregate analyses that find a null effect of voter ID laws. Our results suggest that photo ID laws' deterrent effect persists because voters lack information about the changing requirements for voting, creating confusion that keeps them from voting.},

This paper explains the lobbying success of these industries in terms of the strategic role of investment as a credible commitment device. It is demonstrated that if governments are predisposed to special interest groups, underinvestment in new technology enables firms to lobby more effectively. Such industries are shown to be better placed to extract policy concessions, despite contributing less to the government in political donations. The analysis therefore suggests that political considerations may provide a significant incentive for firms to reject environmentally beneficial investments, even when these lower production costs.},

abstract = {The concept of causality has a controversial history. The question of whether it is possible to represent and address causal problems with probability theory, or if fundamentally new mathematics such as the do-calculus is required has been hotly debated, e.g. [Pearl, 2001] states 'the building blocks of our scientific and everyday knowledge are elementary facts such as "mud does not cause rain" and "symptoms do not cause disease" and those facts, strangely enough, cannot be expressed in the vocabulary of probability calculus'. This has lead to a di-chotomy between advocates of causal graphical modeling and the do-calculus, and researchers applying Bayesian methods. In this paper we demonstrate that, while it is critical to explicitly model our assumptions on the impact of intervening in a system, provided we do so, estimating causal effects can be done entirely within the standard Bayesian paradigm. The invari-ance assumptions underlying causal graphical models can be encoded in ordinary Probabilistic graphical models, allowing causal estimation with Bayesian statistics, equivalent to the do-calculus. Elucidating the connections between these approaches is a key step toward enabling the insights provided by each to be combined to solve real problems.},

Specifically, the notions of a monotonic effect, a weak monotonic effect and a signed edge are introduced. Results are developed relating these monotonic effects and signed edges to the sign of the causal effect of an intervention in the presence of intermediate variables. The incorporation of signed edges into the directed acyclic graph causal framework furthermore allows for the development of rules governing the relationship between monotonic effects and the sign of the covariance between two variables. It is shown that when certain assumptions about monotonic effects can be made then these results can be used to draw conclusions about the presence of causal effects even when data is missing on confounding variables.},

In this paper, we develop a non-parametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman's widely used random forest algorithm. In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect, and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching, especially in the presence of irrelevant covariates.},

abstract = {This paper develops a semi-parametric Bayesian regression model for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data. Standard nonlinear regression models, which may work quite well for prediction, can yield badly biased estimates of treatment effects when fit to data with strong confounding. Our Bayesian causal forests model avoids this problem by directly incorporating an estimate of the propensity function in the specification of the response model, implicitly inducing a covariate-dependent prior on the regression function. This new parametrization also allows treatment heterogeneity to be regularized separately from the prognostic effect of control variables, making it possible to informatively “shrink to homogeneity”, in contrast to existing Bayesian non- and semi-parametric approaches.},

This approach overcomes two important limitations in conventional methods like regression modeling or matching: (i) ambiguity about the pertinent retrospective counterfactuals and (ii) potential misspecification, overfitting, and otherwise bias-prone or inefficient use of a large identifying covariate set in the estimation of causal effects. Our method targets the analysis toward a well-defined “retrospective intervention effect” based on hypothetical population interventions and applies a machine learning ensemble that allows data to guide us, in a controlled fashion, on how to use a large identifying covariate set.

Many social scientists within the academy and this volume have spent years discerning the nature of this truth and articulating its importance for business, organizations, and society. Yet these same scholars face a triple paradox in their work on this important issue. In this essay, we examine those paradoxes—(1) The Paradox of Eliminating the Main Driver, (2) The Paradox of Objectivity and Passion, and (3) The Paradox of Double Irrelevance—and how they are amplified by two institutional factors—the construction of climate truth and its translation in relational fields. We revisit not only how the three paradoxes affect the Anthropocene social scientist as an individual, but, in light of the paradoxes and the two amplifying institutional factors, how she or he might rebalance these tensions by pushing back on each while embracing paradox in personal choices.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Gelman2014,
abstract = {You have just finished running an experiment. You analyze the results, and you find a significant effect. Success! But wait-how much information does your study really give you? How much should you trust your results? In this article, we show that when researchers use small samples and noisy measurements to study small effects-as they often do in psychology as well as other disciplines-a significant result is often surprisingly likely to be in the wrong direction and to greatly overestimate an effect. In this article, we examine some critical issues related to power analysis and the interpretation of findings arising from studies with small sample sizes. We highlight the use of external information to inform estimates of true effect size and propose what we call a design analysis a set of statistical calculations about what could happen under hypothetical replications of a study-that focuses on estimates and uncertainties rather than on statistical significance. As a reminder, the power of a statistical test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis. For any experimental design, the power of a study depends on sample size, measurement variance, the number of comparisons being performed, and the size of the effects being studied. In general, the larger the effect, the higher the power; thus, power calculations are performed conditionally on some assumption of the size of the effect. Power calculations also depend on other assumptions, most notably the size of measurement error, but these are typically not so difficult to assess with available data. It is of course not at all new to recommend the use of statistical calculations on the basis of prior guesses of effect sizes to inform the design of studies. What is new about the present article is as follows: 1. We suggest that design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection and analysis. Abstract Statistical power analysis provides the conventional approach to assess error rates when designing a research study. However, power analysis is flawed in that a narrow emphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study design. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can often be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.},

We use a longitudinal, multiple-case study approach to identify a framework of fundamental choices and consequences that lead to economic and social/ecological value creation. Our findings highlight the interdependence of a set of three fundamental choices (an ambition to cater for multiple purposes, behavioral consistency, and collaboration) that lead to a virtuous circle of reinforcing consequences and cascaded value creation. Furthermore, we show how acceptance of limitations and restrictions functions as a powerful coping mechanism to deal with paradox tensions.},

The NGO implements welfare-maximizing standards under certain conditions; the industry never does.

To address the lack of concept clarity, we conduct a systematic literature review and identify 33 definitions of corporate sustainability. Adopting the Aristotelian perspective on definitions, one that promotes reducing concepts to their essential attributes, we discern four components of corporate sustainability. These components offer a conceptual space of inquiry that, while being parsimonious, offers nuanced understanding of the dimensions along which definitions of corporate sustainability differ. We discuss implications for research and practice and outline several recommendations for how advancements in construct clarity may lead to a better scholarly understanding of corporate sustainability.},

We show that membership in multiple schemes and the firms' position in the CSR-schemes network constitute credible predictors of their sustainability performance, generating a separating equilibrium that distinguishes high from low CSR performers. We develop a model that explains the effectiveness of the CSR-schemes network based on the synergistic properties of the network and on a distinctive signaling dynamic.

We illustrate this approach using an experiment examining the effect of emotion on dyadic trust, as measured by the trust game. Our findings suggest that negative emotions can decrease trust, but only if those negative emotions make people feel less certain about their current situation. Our results suggest that only anxiety, a low-certainty emotion, has a negative impact on trust, whereas anger and guilt, two emotions that differ in their control appraisals but induce the same high level of certainty, appear to have no effect on trusting behavior.

Although rulemaking is an attractive policy-making venue for feminists because it provides them with an opportunity to bypass congressional gridlock and interact with more women policy makers than they might in Congress, the existing literature does not address how and when feminist organizations' participation in rulemaking is influential. To examine this question for the first time, I analyze a sample of the 5,860 comments that the U.S. Department of Education received in response to its 2004 proposed rule allowing for public single-sex education programs and the department's justifications for its proposed and final rules. Specifically, I ask whether findings from the rulemaking literature showing that organizations can encourage bureaucrats to change their proposed rules when they submit large numbers of high-quality, homogenous, opposing comments hold for feminist organizations in a redistributive policy area. The findings indicate that when bureaucrats receive multiple sets of high-quality homogenous comments, they are more likely to side with commenters who support their initial proposals and/or partisan and ideological positions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Leading up to the 2016 election, single women were heralded as the “hot” new constituency. With unmarried women posed to comprise approximately half of the population of adult women and 23{\%} of the electorate (Traister 2016), pundits claimed that the rising number of single women could transform American politics. Building on this recent enthusiasm about single women, this study provides one of the first systematic analyses of how contemporary women's organizations represent single women by analyzing 1,021 comments that women's organizations submitted to rule makers between 2007 and 2013. Using automated text analyses and a series of statistical analyses, it shows that despite the rising numbers of American single women, women's organizations only very rarely explicitly refer to single women during their comment writing campaigns, preferring to highlight the experiences of married mothers instead. Moreover, it shows that the political context unexpectedly has little to no effect on the degree to which women's organizations focus on single women, possibly because they so rarely mention them at all. Altogether, the results suggest that for single women to become politically powerful, they will need more than just large numbers; they may also need niche organizations that can help them organize and articulate their broader policy needs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Judicial review of agency behavior is often criticized as either interfering too much with agencies' domains or doing too little to ensure fidelity to statutory directives and the rule of law. But the Trump administration has produced an unprecedented volume of agency actions that blatantly flout settled administrative-law doctrine. This phenomenon, which we term "regulatory slop," requires courts to reinforce the norms of administrative law by adhering to established doctrine and paying careful attention to remedial options. In this Article, we document numerous examples of regulatory slop and canvass how the Trump agencies have fared in court thus far. We contend that traditional critiques of judicial review carry little force in such circumstances. Further, regulatory slop should be of concern regardless of one's political leanings because it threatens the rule of law. Rather than argue for a change to substantive administrative-law doctrine, therefore, we take a close look at courts' remedial options in such circumstances. We conclude that a strong approach to remedies can send corrective signals to agencies that reinforce both administrative-law values and the rule of law.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} From campaign rhetoric to tweets, President Trump has positioned himself as “disrupter in chief,” often pointing to administrative action as the avenue by which he is leaving a lasting mark. However, research on the administrative presidency begins with the premise that all presidents face incentives to use administrative tools to gain substantive or political traction. If, as this article suggests, Trump's institutional standing differs little from his recent predecessors, then how much of the Trump presidency represents a {\textless}italic{\textgreater}change{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} from past norms and practices? How much represents {\textless}italic{\textgreater}continuity{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} , or the perennial dynamics of a far-from-omnipotent executive in an ongoing world of “separate institutions sharing powers” (Neustadt 1990, 29)?

We found evidence of continuity, indicating that in its use of administrative tactics to shape policy, the Trump White House largely falls in line with recent presidencies. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This article considers the implications of lobbying firms operating as strategic actors in the party system in the United States. It states a partisan theory of legislative subsidy in which members of Congress are inclined to meet with lobbyists when they share a partisan affiliation. It formulates hypotheses that lobbying firms receive greater revenues by being tied to the majority party in Congress and that they are likely to receive greater revenues from being aligned with the House of Representatives than the Senate. These hypotheses are tested using data available under the Lobbying Disclosure Act from 2008 to 2016. Regression analysis reveals that lobbying firms receive financial benefits when they have partisan ties with the majority party in the House but not with the majority party in the Senate. The results indicate that there are greater financial returns to lobbying the House than the Senate. A difference-indifferences analysis establishes that Republican-aligned lobbying firms received a financial windfall when the Republican Party reclaimed the House in 2011 but not when the Republicans reclaimed the Senate in 2015. The outcome of the 2018 midterm congressional election presents another opportunity to test these hypotheses once the 2019 lobbying data become available.},

Understanding such dynamics entails understanding complex relational ties between actors, a task that can be facilitated through the use of network analysis. We argue that a latent feature of interest to scholars of the political economy of finance is one of social distance, which is a measurable concept. Using new data from the financial sector, we measure the social distance between a range of financial firms and one key regulator, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), over time to assess whether or not social distance is related to organizations' advocacy behavior. We find a positive relationship between how close a given organization is to the SEC and how often it engages in advocacy. The result persists when we control for numerous factors related to organizational characteristics, firm size, and when we measure advocacy frequency in different ways.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Although the growth of bureaucracy has accompanied modernization throughout the world, it has been especially unsettling for America's particular system of democracy. American government has adapted to the rise of the administrative state through three, often-conflicting, means of promoting accountability. It has sought to ensure desired qualities in agency decision making through participatory opportunities and standards of rationality that are enforced through the courts. And both the president and Congress have sought to monitor and shape agencies' actions in accordance with their own policy preferences. Each of these controls has received considerable attention, but there are few up-to-date discussions of all three.

@article{Stack2016,
abstract = {Debates over administrative agencies' reliance on guidance documents have largely neglected the most authoritative source of guidance about the meaning of agency regulations: their preambles. This Article examines and defends the guidance function of preambles. Preambles were designed not only to provide the agency's official justification for the regulations they introduce, but also to offer guidance about the regulation's meaning and application. Today, preambles include extensive guidance ranging from interpretive commentary to application examples. Based on the place of preamble guidance as part of the agency's formal explanation of the regulation and the rigorous internal agency vetting which accompanies that formal role, this Article argues that preamble guidance has greater authority than other forms of guidance. That greater authority has important implications. Under current judicial doctrine, preamble guidance warrants greater deference than other forms of guidance. Preamble guidance's superiority also grounds the agency's obligation to act consistently with it—and to revise preamble guidance only in documents issued by the agency, as opposed to lower-level officials, with the same publicity as the original preamble. This obligation should be expressly adopted as a form of internal administrative law either by individual agencies or central executive branch regulators.

abstract = {This article proposes that courts substitute immediate substantive review for procedural review of agency guidance documents. The article begins by reviewing the extensive literature about how courts should treat non-legislative rules. Because such rules play an important role in assuring coherence and accountability of agency policies and interpretations and in communicating the views of agencies about such matters the article agrees with those who advocate ex-post monitoring of agency use of rules issued without notice and comment procedures. Recognizing that ex-post monitoring leaves much leeway for agencies to abuse guidance documents by depriving stakeholders of opportunities to participate in their development and of obtaining substantive judicial review of them, the article advocates that non-legislative rules generally should be subject to arbitrary and capricious review when issued. The article proceeds to explain why other proposals to rein in agency discretion to use guidance documents – in particular making the agency explain its decision to proceed by this mode and forcing the agency to consider timely petitions for reconsideration of such documents – are likely to have less effect with greater cost than its proposal for direct review of guidance documents.

@article{Cook2016,
abstract = {The worries American citizens express about the distorting influence of minority factions, or special interests, on public governance are as old as the republic. I briefly recount the constitutional design flaws and developmental changes that have combined to make these worries more valid than ever in an age of administratively centered governance. I then review the evidence on the nature and extent of special interest influence on the administrative process from a broad swath of scholarship. After noting the limited efficacy of attempts to limit special interest influence via minor tinkering with the separation of powers, I argue for more fundamental structural change in the form of administration as a separate, constitutionally recognized element of the separation of powers. I outline basic structural features and offer hypothetical yet plausible consequences of such a design change. The latter, I contend, are amenable to confirmation or refutation through systematic analysis of evidence that is already available from past and current governing experience. Keywords special interests, administrative power, constitutional redesign During the 1912 campaign for the U.S. presidency, Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson engaged in a spirited debate about how the nation should cope with the trusts, those massive corporate combinations that had emerged in the previous two decades and gained control of markets in a host of vital products and services. Roosevelt called for regulating the trusts through a national commission placed in the executive branch because the effort to break up the trusts through the courts had failed. He insisted that regulating rather than dismantling the trusts would ensure that the competitive advantages of their organizational efficiencies would be preserved. Regulating competition rather than regulating the trusts, Wilson countered, was the better strategy. He contended that regulating the trusts by a commission of experts would be tantamount to allowing corporate monopolies to control the government, because most of the expertise for the regulatory commission would come from the regulated entities. Wilson warned against placing unguided discretion in the hands of such experts. Instead, he called for designing the law regulating competition with sufficient specificity and clarity as to limit administrative discretion, which would ensure that law and not the power of monopoly expertise would prevail.},

In form, these guidances often closely resemble the policies agencies issue in ordinary notice-and-comment rulemaking. However, guidances are generally developed with little public participation and are often immune from judicial review. Nonetheless, guidances can prompt significant changes in behavior from those the agencies regulate. A number of commentators have guardedly defended the current state of affairs. Though guidances lack some important procedural safeguards, they can help agencies supervise low-level employees and supply valuable information to regulated entities regarding how an agency will implement a program. Thus far, however, the debate has largely ignored the distinct and substantial interests of regulatory beneficiaries--those who expect to benefit from government regulation of others. Regulatory beneficiaries include, among others, pharmaceutical consumers, environmental users, and workers seeking safe workplaces. When agencies make policy informally, regulatory beneficiaries suffer distinctive losses to their ability to participate in the agency's decision and to invoke judicial review. This Article argues that considering the interests of regulatory beneficiaries strengthens the case for procedural reform. The Article then assesses some possible solutions.

abstract = {Scholars have avoided studying interest group influence because of the difficulty operationalising the concept. The research presented here introduces a new way of measuring lobbying success and lays out a model of its determinants. To understand why interest groups sometimes succeed and at other times fail, we must consider the institutional structure of the political system within which the advocates are operating; the characteristics of the issue at hand; and finally the characteristics of the interest group itself and their lobbying strategy. I test these factors with original data based on interviews with I49 advocates in Washington D.C. and Brussels active on a random sample of 47 policy issues. From the results, issue context emerges as a much more important determinant of lobbying success than institutional differences. The institutional differences that do emerge suggest that direct elections coupled with private campaign finance lead to winner-take-all outcomes biased in favour of wealthier business interests, while the lack of these institutional characteristics leads to more balanced policy compromises with more advocates achieving some of their policy goals.},

abstract = {This article discusses how the Food and Drug Administration has come to adopt informal guidance (agency advice that influences regulated entities but does not carry the force and effect of law) as its primary method of policymaking, as opposed to more formalized procedures like notice-and-comment rulemaking or case-specific adjudication. Using major developments in administrative law and modifications to FDA's regulatory regime as milestones, the article traces how and why FDA's use of informal guidance to fulfill its statutory mandate has changed over the past century. Along the way, the article identifies important doctrinal questions that persist today, namely (1) whether informal advisory opinions bind FDA and (2) the degree of judicial deference guidance documents should receive under the Supreme Court's decisions in Chevron and Mead. The article attempts to resolve these doctrinal ambiguities. It then undertakes a normative analysis of FDA's increasing reliance on informal guidance, and concludes that, on the whole, this development has benefited FDA's major stakeholders: regulated entities, the general public and the agency itself. The article closes with modest proposals for reform. The article features an appendix with several tables illustrating FDAs output of informal guidance documents by year, to facilitate further study.},

@article{Levin2018,
abstract = {The Administrative Procedure Act imposes a general obligation on federal agencies to use notice-and-comment procedures when they adopt rules, but it contains an exemption, {\S} 553(b)(A), for two kinds of rules that lack the force of law-"interpretative rules" and "general statements of policy." Questions pertaining to the application of this exemption may constitute the single most frequently litigated and important issue of rulemaking procedure in the federal courts today. This article undertakes a comprehensive examination of issues presented by the exemption and offers a unified framework for resolving them. The article deals with procedural questions only and does not address judicial review issues pertaining to these rules. The draftsmanship of {\S} 553(b)(A) has generally been read to imply that interpretive rules and policy statements should be analyzed separately for purposes of the exemption, and, indeed, two separate lines of cases have developed. However, the track records of those two bodies of case law have not proved equally satisfactory. The courts' approach to policy statements is essentially coherent-more so than many scholars acknowledge. It revolves around the issue of whether a statement creates a "binding norm," either legally or in practical effect. Much of the case law on policy statements applies the exemption more narrowly than I would endorse, but the tensions in the precedents result from understandable tradeoffs among competing values. Many of those same values are also reflected in best-practices recommendations adopted by government bodies and professional organizations. In contrast, the case law on interpretive rules is highly unsatisfactory. It is generally understood that an interpretive rule explains existing law instead of creating new law. However, the approaches by which courts apply this criterion are not only vague, but also lack credible policy justifications that would enable courts and agencies to find their way past the vagueness.

The federal agency's rulemaking is controversial because of its perceived complexity, lack of transparency, and lengthy duration. To shed light on the FDA's rulemaking process, we examined the evolution of significant rules that the agency published during 2000-12 for drugs, devices, and other medical products. We found that the rules' median time to finalization was 7.3 years, with the pre-rule phase and postreview deliberation within the FDA accounting for the majority of that time. Rules that involved mandatory cost-benefit analyses were associated with an additional delay of approximately two years. We also found that longer review times were significantly associated with a reduction in the stringency of final rules, compared to the originally proposed versions. We recommend improving FDA's rulemaking by allocating additional resources to increase efficiency and by embarking on initiatives to promote transparency by the FDA and other parts of the executive branch.},

abstract = {Administrative law has ceased to respond adequately to the challenges posed by modern-day executive government. We suggest that the discordance reflects a mismatch between the debilities of the Congress and an administrative regime built on legislative supremacy.

Administrative law — in its New Deal and its modern, post-Chevron forms — presuppose a Congress that is jealous of its legislative powers. However, the modern Congress has increasingly dis-empowered itself. It consistently fails to update old statutes even when they are manifestly outdated or, as actually administered, have assumed contours that neither the enacting nor the current Congress would countenance. When Congress does legislate, it tends to enact highly convoluted and often incoherent “hyper-legislation.”

We examine the effects first on agencies, and then on courts and their doctrines. Knowing that there is no turning (back) to Congress, agencies are tempted to improvise policies lacking legislative authority. In turn, administrative law doctrines that were developed under very different institutional conditions start to bend.

We describe three increasingly common forms of agency action: (1) agency “re-writes” of statutes; (2) procedural shell games and manipulation; and (3) broad regulatory waivers without or in excess of a statutory warrant. We provide illustrations in the “old statutes” and “hyper-legislation” settings. Our principal old-statute example is the Clean Air Act and the protracted litigation over the EPA's regulation of greenhouse gases, culminating (for now) in the Supreme Court's decision in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA. Our principal examples of hyper-legislation are the Dodd-Frank Act and the Affordable Care Act, including the pending litigation over the scope of the act's subsidy and mandate provisions.

We conclude with a plea for more institutional realism and less interpretive metaphysics in administrative law.

@unpublished{Graham2015,
abstract = {The federal regulatory system includes two important components, each designed to ensure that the regulatory process works to advance the interests of the American people. First, the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 (APA) compels regulatory agencies to consider the wishes of the American public via a process of public participation in rulemaking. Second, regulatory review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), in place since the early 1980s, provides assurance that a minimal level of evidence, especially economic evidence, is supplied to support agency decisions. Along with judicial review and congressional oversight, these components provide the checks and balances that are the foundation of the modern regulatory state.

Whether intentionally or not, agencies often avoid these procedural requirements. A recent study finds that agencies avoided the notice-and-comment process, which facilitates public participation in rulemaking, in almost 52 percent of regulations finalized from 1995 to 2012. Meanwhile, only about 8 percent of final regulations underwent OIRA scrutiny between fiscal years 2004 and 2013. More troubling, however, is the fact that agencies can evade checks and balances altogether via an array of mechanisms that circumvent or bypass the traditional rulemaking process. This type of under-the-radar rulemaking is known as stealth regulation.

legislative process is dead, if it was ever an accurate description in the

without prior comment; outsourcing to lawmaking commissions and
unconventional delegates; process shortcuts outside of emergencies;
presidential policymaking; and outside drafters, some nonpartisan and
others hyperpartisan. These unorthodoxies are everywhere, and they have

traditionally part of the core lawmaking and rulemaking processes. These
unorthodoxies are the new textbook process.

however, have paid little attention to these evolutions. The limited
commentary that does exist tends to lump all unorthodox policymaking
together or to preserve an artificial divide between their legislative and
administrative manifestations. But omnibus policymaking is different
from emergency policymaking-not only in process and product, but in
the challenges that each poses for courts. And both forms of policymaking

This description and analysis includes discussion of how courts determine when a rule is legislative or nonlegislative, what deference courts give to nonlegislative rules, and when preenforcement challenges are ripe for judicial review.

@article{Franklin2010,
abstract = {Courts have long struggled to distinguish legislative rules, which are designed to have binding legal effect and must go through the rulemaking procedure known as notice and comment, from nonlegislative rules, which are not meant to have binding legal effect and are exempted from notice and comment. The distinction has been called "tenuous," "baffling," and "enshrouded in considerable smog." What is just as baffling is that prominent commentators such as John Manning, William Funk, Donald Elliott, and Jacob Gersen have proposed a simple solution to the problem -and courts have failed to take them up on it. Rather than inquiring into a rule's nature or effects to decide whether it must undergo notice and comment, these commentators urge, courts should turn the question inside-out and ask whether the rule has undergone notice and comment in order to determine whether it can be made legally binding. This proposal, which I call the "short cut," would economize on judicial decision costs. Moreover, its proponents say, it would not reduce oversight of the administrative process, because agencies would often opt to submit their rules to notice and comment ex ante in order to ensure that they are treated as legally binding ex post. Lately, proponents of the short cut such as Manning and Gersen have argued that their position is strengthened by the Supreme Court's 2001 Mead decision, which presumptively disqualifies nonlegislative rules from Chevron deference. This Article explains not only why judges have resisted the short cut, but also why they have been wise to do so. It argues that caution is warranted for three reasons: the short cut inadequately protects the interests of those persons, particularly regulatory beneficiaries, whose interests are affected by deregulatory or permissive agency pronouncements; it stands in tension with the longstanding principle that agencies may choose to announce new policy through either adjudication or rulemaking; and it ignores important differences between public scrutiny at the promulgation stage and heightened judicial scrutiny at the enforcement stage. Nor, I argue, does the Mead decision lend decisive force to the arguments in favor of the short cut, because nonlegislative rules are often accorded substantial deference in practice. These, in short, are the perils of the short cut.},

abstract = { Interest groups are a major channel through which citizens can express
 their opinions to decision-makers.' Their participation in policymaking
 may improve decision-making processes by supporting policies that are in
 line with citizen preferences and blocking policies that solely reflect the
 interests of the governing elite. At the same time, however, intense
 interest group pressures may make it difficult for policy-makers to
 implement the most efficient policies since such policies often impose
 costs on parts of the public. Competition among interest groups over the
 distribution of economic gains may also slow down the rate of economic
 growth (Olson I982). Finally, if some groups constantly win, interest
 group politics may undermine the legitimacy of electorally accountable
 decision making in a democracy.
 A normative assessment of the role of interest groups in democracies
 thus crucially depends upon how much power interest groups have, and
 how power is distributed among different groups. Moreover, an under-
 standing of the role of interest groups in the policymaking process is
 essential for explanations of policy outcomes. Finally, analysts trying to
 advise government on policies also have to be aware of the power of
 interest groups, as this factor determines the political feasibility of
 different suggestions. In short, research into variations in influence across
 groups and political systems is important for a series of reasons.

This report summarizes the Task Force's deliberations, indicating ways that federal agencies could do a better job of seeking citizen comment earlier in the rulemaking process and of reaching out to all affected groups in an evenhanded manner. The report includes not only targeted recommendations on transparency and public participation, but also strategic-management recommendations which, if adopted, should help ensure that agencies continue to improve their transparency and public participation practices over time.

abstract = {Recent research suggests that patterns of interaction among organized American interests have important implications for pluralist theory. The research presented here confirms that competition for policy attention exists among multiple interests having divided policy goals. However, the findings challenge the view that a proliferation of organizations leads to actual competition between interest groups as issues are resolved. It does so by shifting the level of analysis from the domain level to the issue level in order to provide a common substantive context for elite/pluralist interpretations. The analysis argues, using transaction theory, that organized interests cultivate specific and recognizable identities. From these identities, they come to occupy issue niches where they only infrequently ally themselves with or become adversaries of other interests. Rather than do so, most interests accommodate one another by concentrating on very narrow issues. Only a few organizations, usually the least influential, focus on encompassing or sectorwide issues or become large scale coalition players. That is, most interest groups avoid conflict situations. The data base includes interviews with 238 interest representatives, tracing their involvement on 402 prioritized issues and 180 acts and regulations that were finally passed.

abstract = {Bureaucratic resistance has long been a feature of the administrative state. What is striking is the extent to which it has become publicly defiant under the Trump Administration. Civil servants are openly flouting executive directives in their official capacity, despite strong norms to the contrary. The social practice raises both parallels and contrasts to civil disobedience by private citizens—meriting an analogous need for sustained scholarly debate about the phenomenon. This symposium article seeks to isolate civil servant disobedience conceptually and begin an exploration into its normative implications. In particular, it considers the ideal of a reciprocal hierarchy, whereby political appointees consult the expertise and experience of career staff as required by statute. This ideal may help to inform evaluations of civil servant disobedience as a form of bureaucratic process-perfection alongside other legitimating criteria. These factors, however, may also suggest that disobedience is often difficult to justify in practice.

@book{VANDERVEN2019,
abstract = {From green frogs and blue angels to white bunnies, modern consumers are confronted by a growing array of colorful eco-labels on everything from coffee to computers. When eco-labels are credible, they can lead to dramatic change in environmental practices broadly and quickly by leveraging the purchasing power of corporate clients (e.g., Walmart and McDonalds) to influence global supply chains. But the credibility of such labels is highly variable; and despite the existence of established practices for eco-labeling, many labels remain little more than superficial exercises in "greenwash." How can consumers separate greenwash from genuine attempts to address environmental challenges? 

Beyond Greenwash addresses this question by systematically investigating the credibility of transnational eco-labeling organizations across countries and commercial sectors. Using an innovative proxy measure for credibility that examines adherence to established best practices, Hamish van der Ven proposes a novel theory of rigor and credibility in transnational eco-labeling that upends conventional wisdom. He argues that the credibility of an eco-label does not depend on who creates or manages it-whether a government, industry association, professional standard setter, or environmental NGO. Rather, it depends on which types of businesses use the label. More specifically, eco-labeling organizations that target bigger, consumer-facing retailers tend to create credible eco-labels out of a desire to insulate their clients from critical scrutiny and gain acceptance in new markets. This theory challenges the conventional wisdom that only governments or environmental NGOs can create meaningful environmental governance and suggests that who is being governed matters as much, if not more, than who is doing the governing.},

abstract = {"Much has been written about the historic nature of the Obama campaign. The multi-year, multi-billion dollar operation elected the nation's first black president, raised and spent more money than any other election effort in history, and built the most sophisticated voter targeting technology ever before used on a national campaign. But what is missing from these accounts is an understanding of how Obama for America organized its formidable army of 2.2 million volunteers -- over eight times the number of people who volunteered for democratic candidates in 2004. Unlike previous field campaigns that drew their power from staff, consultants, and paid canvassers, the Obama campaign's capacity came from unpaid local citizens who took responsibility for organizing their own neighborhoods months--and even years--in advance of election day. In so doing, Groundbreakers argues, the campaign enlisted citizens in the often unglamorous but necessary work of practicing democracy. Hahrie Han and Elizabeth McKenna argue that the legacy of Obama for America is a transformation of the traditional models of field campaigning. Groundbreakers makes the case that the Obama ground game was revolutionary in two regards not captured in previous accounts. First, the campaign piloted and scaled an alternative model of field campaigning that built the power of a community at the same time that it organized it. Second, the Obama campaign changed the individuals who were a part of it, turning them into leaders. Groundbreakers proves that presidential campaigns are still about more than clicks, big data and money, and that one of the most important ways that a campaign develops its capacity is by investing in its human resources"-- 1.

abstract = {"Why are some civic associations better than others at getting--and keeping--people involved in activism? From MoveOn.org to the National Rifle Association, Health Care for America Now to the Sierra Club, membership-based civic associations constantly seek to engage people in civic and political action. What makes some more effective than others? Using in-person observations, surveys, and field experiments, this book compares organizations with strong records of engaging people in health and environmental politics to those with weaker records. To build power, civic associations need quality and quantity (or depth and breadth) of activism. They need lots of people to take action and also a cadre of leaders to develop and execute that activity. Yet, models for how to develop activists and leaders are not necessarily transparent. This book provides these models to help associations build the power they want and support a healthy democracy. In particular, the book examines organizing, mobilizing, and lone wolf models of engagement and shows how highly active associations blend mobilizing and organizing to transform their members' motivations and capacities for involvement. This is not a simple story about the power of offline versus online organizing. Instead, it is a story about how associations can blend both online and offline strategies to build their activist base. In this compelling book, Hahrie Han explains how civic associations can invest in their members and build the capacity they need to inspire action"-- Chapter 1 Introduction -- Chapter 2 Setting Up the Comparative Case Studies -- Chapter 3 Choosing Strategies for Building Power -- Chapter 4 Organizing -- Chapter 5 Mobilizing -- Chapter 6 Conclusion -- Appendix A: Methods.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes two common features of markets in which eco-label programs certify that products are “green”: gradation—single programs offering multiple certification standards (e.g., platinum, gold, silver)—and competition—multiple programs vying to certify to their respective standards. We find that, depending on whether programs are sponsored by industry, environmental groups, or a government, they have strikingly different incentives to grade or compete. Industry sponsors are indifferent about both; environmentalist sponsors optimally grade or compete with other environmentalist sponsors only if consumer preferences for green consumption are skewed in a specific way; and government sponsors׳ decisions depend on the relative importance of private vs. public benefits generated by the green market. We find also that it is no accident that green markets frequently have an environmentalist program competing with an industry one. For each of the cases examined, our analysis is consistent with casual empirical evidence.},

We introduce a supply chain strategy framework to address three questions: (a) What are the requisite supply chain conditions for certification programs to be successful? (b) How well does the tropical timber sector meet these conditions? (c) What actions could make FSC certification efforts more effective? We conclude that some conditions necessary for a successful supply chain strategy are not found in the tropical timber industry. As a result, FSC certification faces severe limitations as a governance tool for tropical forest conservation. We suggest that a collaborative approach to creating markets for certified timber will improve FSC certificate program effectiveness.},

To probe the prospects and limits of this shift toward eco-consumerism as a mechanism for global change, this article analyzes its value for improving forest management globally. It reveals that eco-consumerism is improving some aspects; yet, for both supply and demand-side reasons, the advances are incremental and unequal and overall doing little to slow deforestation. The article therefore highlights the danger of overestimating the potential of voluntary eco-certification and advances a set of policy and management solutions to enhance the effectiveness of eco-consumer initiatives such as forest certification. Solutions include internal incremental adjustments to certification programs, coordinated alongside more fundamental external systemic changes in the marketing, industrial use, and valuation of the world's forests.},

We also propose that corporate environmental disclosure moderates these relationships. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 241 U.S. firms included in Newsweek's Green Rankings. Our results suggest that managers should avoid decoupling because such practices heavily jeopardize environmental reputation.

abstract = {Private governance regimes—instances where nonstate actors set rules that govern their behavior and/or the behavior of others—are increasingly common intermediaries between activists and corporations. Activists are often thought to drive corporations to participate in private governance. By participating, corporations hope to be shielded from activist pressures. Yet there are many instances where activists oppose particular private governance regimes, even ones that are seen as leaders in a sector. Why is this? This article contributes answers to this question by examining how activists' different strategic orientations affect their perceptions of private governance. It unpacks three distinct ideal-type strategic orientations—prefiguration, targeting, and cooperation—activists may hold in their efforts to transform markets and the different forms of private governance each orientation will prefer. It then details how market entry conditions, sequencing and interactions, and feedbacks affect how activists ...},

abstract = {In this article, we argue that prior organizations research has contributed to the erosion of the natural environment by failing to discriminate physical materiality from sociomateriality. The time–space attributes of physical materiality are more immutable than sociomateriality, so the compression of time and space in and by organizations is disrupting the cycles of the natural environment. We illustrate this point through the example of carbon markets. The development of futures and other financial derivatives contributes to the compression of time, whereas the movement of capital worldwide contributes to the compression of space. This time–space compression disembodies financial instruments from their physical target, namely, carbon, leading to the distortion of the instrument's “real” value and hampering carbon emissions reductions. We call for organizational theories that more fully account for physical materiality.},

This article proposes that such approaches contribute to neoliberalization and its legitimation. Using a case study of the sustainable seafood movement and its use of market-based approaches, this article analyzes the ways that the movement's consumer, restaurant, and retailer campaigns contribute to and legitimate neoliberalization. Specifically, in using market-based approaches, sustainable seafood organizations are contributing to and legitimating neoliberal notions of individualism, marketization, and the devolution of regulatory authority. Given such findings, I argue that the sustainable seafood movement is “in the market and for it.” As such, I suggest the movement's transformative capacity may be limited, and in using market-based approaches it may be facilitating processes of capitalist accumulation that environmental sociologists have widely identified as antithetical to environmental sustainability.},

Against this backdrop, we consider how hybrid organizations (organizations at the interface between for-profit and nonprofit sectors that address social and ecological issues) are operating at odds with beliefs embedded in strategic management and corporate sustainability literatures. We offer six propositions that define hybrid organizations based on challenges they present to the beliefs embedded in these literatures and position them as new heretics of strategic management and corporate sustainability orthodoxy.

John Ahlquist and Margaret Levi document eighty years of such activism by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union in the United States and the Waterside Workers Federation in Australia. They systematically compare the ILWU and WWF to the Teamsters and the International Longshoremen's Association, two American transport industry labor unions that actively discouraged the pursuit of political causes unrelated to their own economic interests. Drawing on a wealth of original data, Ahlquist and Levi show how activist organizations can profoundly transform the views of members about their political efficacy and the collective actions they are willing to contemplate. They find that leaders who ask for support of projects without obvious material benefits must first demonstrate their ability to deliver the goods and services members expect. These leaders must also build governance institutions that coordinate expectations about their objectives and the behavior of members. In the Interest of Others reveals how activist labor unions expand the community of fate and provoke preferences that transcend the private interests of individual members. Ahlquist and Levi then extend this logic to other membership organizations, including religious groups, political parties, and the state itself."--Provided by publisher.

abstract = {presidential tweets to online grocery shopping, the Internet has revolutionized many aspects of modern life, including the way that the public engages with the federal government's rulemaking process. Not long ago, an individual wanting to submit a comment on an agency proposed rule would have to track down a paper copy of the Federal Register and mail a letter. Today, the public can comment on draft regulations in one click on www.regulations.gov, the web clearinghouse for agency rulemakings. This technological innovation means that agencies now routinely receive thousands – and sometimes even millions – of comments on draft rules. It also has given new life to lobbying in the form of public comment campaigns, or groups of identical public comments that are akin to form letters and are drafted by interest groups.[1] For instance, when the Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the controversial Waters of the United States (WOTUS) proposed rule in 2014 it received more than one million public comments, of which approximately 90{\%} were identical comments organized via campaigns.

Lobbying in the form of public comment campaigns is often dismissed as “notice and spam,” suggesting that since individual commenters invest little time in drafting these comments, agencies have scant reason to take them seriously. Yet, not much is known about these campaigns—how frequent they are, which groups sponsor them, and whether they have any substantive effect on public policy.

In order to investigate the issue systematically, I collected data on the number, size, and content of public comment campaigns targeting the EPA on proposed rules issued from 2007—2014,[2] following the agency's own definition, which includes all instances in which identical comments were submitted by multiple parties.[3] This exercise indicated that public comment campaigns are routine, at least for environmental rulemaking;[4] of the 359 EPA proposed rules in my dataset, 57 (16{\%}) were subject to at least one public comment campaign.  Further, 33 of the proposed rules (9{\%}) were subject to three or more campaigns.

Because the EPA is an agency tasked with arbitrating between two often-conflicting interests, the environment and industry, I also considered how these perspectives were represented in comment campaigns. For each campaign where the sponsoring organization was identifiable,[5] I coded whether the sponsor was an industry group (e.g., a corporation, trade association, union, or profit-oriented entity), an advocacy group (i.e., an organization centered on advancing the public interest or advocating for a specific cause), or some other type of group. },

abstract = {Second edition. A comprehensive overview of the field of comparative administrative law that builds on the first edition with many new and revised chapters, additional topics and extended geographical coverage. This Research Handbook's broad, multi-method approach combines history and social science with more strictly legal analyses. This new edition demonstrates the growth and dynamism of recent efforts - spearheaded by the first edition - to stimulate comparative research in administrative law and public law more generally, reaching across different countries and scholarly disciplines. A particular focus is on administrative independence with its manifold implications for separation of powers, democratic self-government, and the boundary between law, politics, and policy. Several chapters highlight the tensions between impartial expertise and public accountability; others consider administrative litigation and the role of the courts in reviewing both individual decisions and secondary norms. The book concludes by asking how administrative law is shaping and is being shaped by the changing boundaries of the state, especially shifting boundaries between the public and the private, and the national and the supranational domains. This extensive and interdisciplinary appraisal of the field will be a vital resource for scholars and students of administrative and comparative law worldwide, and for public officials and representatives of interest groups engaged with government policy implementation and regulation.-- Introduction / Susan Rose-Ackerman, Peter L.

@article{JosephOConnell2008,
abstract = {Despite the administrative state's extensive scope, we know little about how it operates as an empirical matter. This Article provides the first comprehensive empirical examination of agency rulemaking, with and without prior public comment, from President Ronald Reagan to President George W. Bush. Using a large new dataset constructed from twenty years' (1983-2003) worth of federal agencies' semi-annual reports in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, this Article analyzes variation in agency rulemaking activities with an emphasis on rulemaking at the beginning and end of presidential administrations and around shifts in party control of Congress -- midnight and crack-of-dawn regulatory activity -- while also assessing some patterns outside those periods.

The empirical results offer new insights into the rulemaking process and the interplay of politics and regulation. Some of these insights are surprising. For example, certain agencies withdrew more proposed rules after political transitions in Congress than after a new President took office. Rather than capitalizing quickly on their electoral mandates, Presidents generally started fewer, not more, rules in the first year of their terms than in later years. Agencies generally did complete more rules in the final quarter of each presidential administration, but cabinet departments (as a group), finished slightly more actions after the 1994 election changed control of Congress than in President Clinton's last quarter. And although the press highlighted President Clinton's spate of midnight regulatory activity, President George H.W. Bush began nearly 50 percent more notice-and-comment rulemakings in the final quarter of his term than did President Clinton and nearly 40 percent more than President Reagan.

The results have potentially far-reaching normative and doctrinal implications for the functioning and oversight of the administrative state. Politics aside, many agencies have engaged in considerable notice-and-comment rulemaking, suggesting that the traditional regulatory process may not be significantly ossified. Nevertheless, binding rulemaking without prior comment has increased across a wide range of agencies. Focusing on politics, these patterns of regulatory activity during political transitions undermine theories of judicial deference based entirely on agency expertise. But, at the same time, they do not support a political accountability theory based solely on the President. Rather, the regulatory trends call attention to the importance of Congress, in addition to the President, for bureaucratic oversight. In sum, the timing of rulemaking raises interesting questions about the effectiveness and legitimacy of the administrative state.

abstract = {Climate policy stability is often considered to be instrumental in redirecting significant financial
flows toward climate action by minimizing risk and uncertainty for investors. The logic is that
uncertain climate policies create too many risks for private sector actors seeking to engage in
low-carbon ventures. There are, however, many sources of instability that complicate the
enactment of enduring responses along with tensions between policy stability and adaptability in
the context of multidecadal processes of low-carbon innovation. And so, instead of emphasising
policy stability, we adopt a somewhat more modest goal: stabilizing the overarching orientation
of climate policy as a transition towards a low-carbon economy. That is, we are principally
concerned with the role of policy in making the low-carbon course of development durable,
signalling continuous movement in this direction. It is this goal that motivates our analysis and
raises two central research questions. First, how can the overarching direction of low-carbon
change be stabilized, avoiding the reversal or erosion of the low-carbon course of development?
Second, through which specific mechanisms might this policy orientation be instilled with
greater “stability, coherence, and integrity as time passes, achieving its basic promised goals
[i.e., decarbonization] amid the inevitable vicissitudes of politics” (Patashnik, 2003, p. 207)? In
order to address these interrelated questions, this paper surveys the diverse literature on policy
stickiness, drawing on three concepts of particular relevance for this discussion: path
dependency, policy feedback, and transition pathways. From this, we distill four prominent
mechanisms that may help stabilize the overarching climate policy orientation and entrench the
low-carbon transition: (1) increasing the political cost of reversal or erosion; (2) encouraging the
emergence and development of supportive policy constituencies; (3) embedding the low-carbon
transition within a supportive ecosystem of institutions; and (4) building societal legitimacy for
the low-carbon transition. These mechanisms are summarized below.},

abstract = {“When has a public comment on a federal regulation actually made a significant difference?”

This question consistently arises during workshops, presentations, volunteer trainings, and even from the editor of our article in The Conversation. As an organization whose mission is to encourage scientists and other experts to submit public comments, this question cuts to the heart of The Public Comment Project.

The “success” story that first inspired us at The Public Comment Project involves a comment made by a marine scientist on a rule designating critical habitat for the endangered black abalone. “Critical habitat,” is set aside for special management and protection because it is essential to the conservation and recovery of an endangered or threatened species. In response to this particular public comment, the National Marine Fisheries Service expanded critical habitat for the black abalone to better protect early life stages of the species. (Read more about it here!)

A more far-reaching example is the 2015 proposal to amend federal regulations on research with biospecimens. The many public comments made on the original proposal, and the resulting changes those comments inspired, were summarized by folks at The Hastings Center Bioethics Forum as “successfully” impacting the final regulations.

Public comments have also been used to strengthen regulatory decisions, such as when federal agencies used submitted information and studies to support Endangered Species Act listings of the hyacinth macaw and the Taiwanese humpback dolphin. And there are many minor examples where public comments initiated key clarifications in the language of the regulation. This includes an August 2018 rule on a renewable fuel standards program, and a July 2016 rule on the use of Medicare data.

At the Public Comment Project, we now begin our workshops by highlighting a few of these examples, which is how we kicked off our most recent workshop for the Science Rising effort.

Our workshops engage a wide variety of experts in the public comment process, allowing us to branch out from our more academic roots. Each workshop draws in a new – and equally important – dimension of the public: students, non-academic scientists, community leaders, and concerned citizens. Partnering with Science Rising was especially rewarding in this respect, as we were able to reach a new community of potential public commenters.

With such a diversity of experiences, backgrounds, and goals, there is always a new question raised or opinion given. And many of these questions, like the one above, get at the core of the public comment process.},

abstract = {The rise of congressional polarization has led presidents to seek alternative ways to pursue their
agendas through staffing. I argue presidents use excepted appointments, which are excepted both from
advice and consent and competitive hiring processes, when ideological conflict within the Senate is high. I
also argue that Schedule C appointments specifically are concentrated in agencies ideologically similar to
the president due to their advisory nature. I find preliminary support for these hypotheses using Office of
Personnel Management data on Schedule C appointees from 1998 to 2013. In sum, this study shows
that excepted appointments are an important yet understudied tool in the president's administrative
toolbox.
Keywords: presidency, appointments, Schedule C, excepted service, administrative presidency,
polarization
Few topics have received as much popular and scholarly attention as the rise of congressional
polarization and its impact on government performance. Scholars and journalists
have often blamed partisan conflict within Congress for low congressional approval
ratings (Binder 2003), understaffed courts and agencies (Binder and Maltzman 2009;
Viser 2013), and an inability to act on key issues (Weisman 2013) or simply run the dayto-day
operations of the government (Helderman 2011). Within the Senate, critics have
long blamed the filibuster for fueling obstructionist tendencies and holding up meaningful
reforms (Binder and Smith 1997; Smith 2014). In 2013, Democrats resorted to using
the nuclear option following frequent, prolonged Republican obstruction via filibuster
on the president's lower-level judicial nominees. Frustration with this obstruction was
especially apparent prior to the November 2016 election as Republicans in the Senate
refused to consider Merrick Garland's Supreme Court nomination. In an era of increasingly
polarized congressional parties, presidents have faced greater obstacles to filling key
vacancies in both the executive branch and in the judiciary},

@article{Skocpol2004,
abstract = {Nearly a century ago, the American Political Science Association was launched at a December 1903 meeting held at Tulane University in New Orleans during the joint conventions of the American Economics Association and the American Historical Association.  That founding was the culmination of a year-long process of tapping the opinions of scholars and men of affairs interested – as the original circular letter put it -- in “the establishment of some representative body that can take the scientific lead in all matters of a political interest, encouraging research, aiding if possible in the collection and publication of valuable material and, in general advancing the scientific study of politics in the United States.”1   Did it make more sense – asked the circular letter -- to organize special-interest sections within the AEA, the AHA and the American Social Science Association or to launch an independent national association?  Fortunately for us, prospective members overwhelmingly chose the latter course.  In New Orleans, they adopted a constitution and elected founding officers for the American Political Science Association, including Frank J. Goodnow of Columbia University as the first president.  Much has changed over the past century.  An Association that started with founding participants numbering in the dozens now boasts about 14,000 members.  An association once closely focused on the formal arrangements of law and government now encompasses a much broader understanding of politics; and presidential addresses over the decades document the emergence of behavioralism, systems theories, and rational choice to coexist with new variants of institutional analysis.  An association that originally functioned through ten scholarly and 
 2governing committees now has 47 program divisions, 35 organized sections, 55 related groups, and 42 committees devoted to governance, awards, and representation. Each year, some 700 people, about one of every twenty members, participates in the voluntary leadership of the APSA and its sections. Last but not least, an association founded by white men now includes a rainbow of persons and is about to witness the first instance in which a woman president hands off the gavel to a female successor.       Despite the many changes over the decades, there have been important continuities – so many that Frank Goodnow and his colleagues would surely recognize us today as understandable inheritors of the association and disciplinary vision they launched in 1903.  Now, as then, organized political science encompasses normative theory as well as empirical research.  Now, as then, the APSA features comparative research, area studies, and a focus on international politics as well as studies of American politics; and our membership is international.  The APSA fosters pedagogy as well as research.  We nurture ties to neighboring disciplines and proudly include scholars who started elsewhere in our ranks.  Now, as then, we aim to link responsible citizenship in the larger society to scholarly studies of government and politics.  In the words of Pendleton Herring delivered in his APSA presidential address fifty years ago, “as we {\ldots} develop political science as a discipline we both serve our professional needs and perform the vital function of helping our democracy to know itself better.

widow, sat in the shovel of a bulldozer for more than an hour to
protest the building of an interstate highway through a section of
town occupied by historic homes. Mrs. Cooke, the widow, sat in the
shovel sobbing softly as police demanded that the women move. "This
is such a lovely town," she said, "I do not know what will become of
it." After repeated threats of arrest, the women finally gave way and
the bulldozer began ripping into a frame house a block from a mansion
where Washington spent a winter in 1779. The State Highway
Department was unmoved by the protest. A spokesman said: "These
women just aren't looking at the big picture. Our route has been approved,
and we are going through with it."
In Mt. Vernon, New York, on the same day, it was reported that
work on widening a parkway was resumed after the failure of a demonstration
by residents. A few days before, dozens of housewives and
businessmen, angered that age-old trees were to be torn down for the
highway, had stationed themselves at dawn in front of heavy machinery
used in building the highway. Police demanded that they
leave and workmen started a bulldozer roaring toward the residents,
who linked arms and refused to budge. The police pulled the line
apart, twisting arms and legs. Men in business suits fell down, women's
handbags flew open, and fifteen persons, who had made themselves
dead weight on the ground, were finally carried away bodily. Sixteen
persons were arrested, including a rabbi, two pregnant women, and
the wife of a Westchester County Supervisor. A New York Transit
Police Captain, also a resident, was arrested for punching a policeman.

that a woman could speak authoritatively in a public setting at all.

@misc{Herz2018,
abstract = {1 – The important thing is less the opportunity than the actuality. So perhaps: “Robust public
engagement is vital to the rulemaking process. It permits agencies . . . .” the problem with that is that
you have defined “public engagement” to be something the agency does, not something the public
does. Given that, “robust public engagement” is wrong, but so is what the draft now has (which says
that the opportunity for agencies to do outreach is vital, which is not right). So, what about: “Full and
effective public participation is vital to the rulemaking process. It permits agencies to obtain more
comprehensive information, enhances the legitimacy of their decisions, and enhances increases public
support for their rules.”
10 – “primarily, if not solely,” in place of “considerably”
11 – delete “rulemaking”
11-12 – “Although this generates important information” for “Although agencies receive important
information from the public during the notice-and-comment process”
13 – “public engagement” seems to be being used in a different sense here as well. Replace
“engagement” with “participation”
14 – “NPRM” for “notice of proposed rulemaking”
14-15 – Move “particularly before issuing an NPRM” to the end of the sentence
22 – I admit it took me a while to grasp the specialized meaning of “public engagement,” even though
you do define it here. Perhaps out of an abundance of caution, and for clarity, this could say something
like: “For purposes of this Recommendation, ‘public engagement' refers to activities by the agency, not
activities by the public. It includes all efforts to . . . .”
25 – delete “efforts”
26 – this sentence says “through the rulemaking process”, but at line 21 it says “before issuing NPRMs”.
One or the other should go. I'd delete “before issuing NPRMs” but I defer
32 – delete “efforts”
33 – “hold” for “garner”
35 – delete hyphen between “wide” and “range”; delete “affected”
38 – perhaps “useful” for “informed” 
40 – “pursue” for “undergo”
41 – delete “efforts”
43 – I'd say: “Each method will have both distinct benefits and distinct drawbacks.”
FN6 – “Some” for “other” [“other” doesn't work because the text doesn't identify any agency or
agencies in the first place]
50 – insert “these two mechanisms are” in between “While” and “similar”
50-52 – “to solicit information” seems unnecessary. Also, the difference between choosing “an approach
to take” (RFI) and choosing between “several alternative proposals” (ANPR) is pretty vague. Maybe:
“RFIs are generally used when an agency is determining whether to proceed at all and, if so, what
general approach to take. ANPRMs are generally used when the agency has formulated one or more
regulatory proposals, but only tentatively.”
55 – I don't know what “formal” means here, or exactly what the point of the introductory clause is.
Perhaps just delete that clause and say “RFIs and ANPRMs provide agencies {\ldots}.”
61 – In addition to FACA is the PRA potentially relevant enough to mention?
67 – As per the discussion at the October 5 committee meeting, this is a place it would be good to add a
little more about the value of these sorts of meetings. Maybe something along these lines: “When all
goes well, these more dialogic sessions can produce new ideas and creative solutions that would be
missed when stakeholders simply assert their existing positions. They also can lead to some change in
stakeholders' positions in light of a greater understanding of others' concerns.”
71 – delete “efforts”
72 – “appropriate” for “qualified”
73 – not sure what “presumably” means. “presumptively”? “ordinarily”?
73 – “separate webpage” is unclear. Separate from what?
72-74 – At line 72 it's “agencies”; at line 74 it's “an agency”; need to clean that up
74 – “contemplated” is awkward and inaccurate; only some contemplated rules are relevant. I think we
could just say “these” in place of “contemplated”},

@misc{Farina2018,
abstract = {Attached are my comments on the draft recommendations. They focus on three points:
 The importance of proactive outreach strategies, because people/groups who do not
typically participate in RM are often not watching the typical agency information outlets
 Providing info about the RM process – and the role of public participation in it – as both
a motivator to participation (why someone should expend time and energy) and as a
guide to the kind of participation that is effective and useful
 Providing substantive information in a readable, comprehensible form that new
participants can, and will, engage with
I hope that these points will also get some attention in the text preceding the
recommendations. Wider and better participation won't come from simply adding a Notice of
Inquiry or public meeting unless the agency also (1) works hard to get new people/groups into
the real or virtual room and (2) supplies substantive info in a manner much different than
conventional rulemaking materials. Based on the CeRI experience with RegulationRoom, my
concern is that more stages of formal process are unlikely to broaden useful participation without
significant changes in how agencies publicize rulemakings and participation opportunities, as
well as in how they provide information about the relevant issues and questions.

@article{Rauch2016,
abstract = {Waxing eloquent, some claim that such e-rulemaking might fundamentally
transform the participatory process. 6 For now, however, the process is defined
by a more pedestrian phenomenon: spain. In typical e-rulemakings, agencies
receive thousands of comments that are short, identical statements of support or
opposition to a proposal.'
Given this deluge, some deride the current system as "notice and spain"
rulemaking, 8 treating identical posts as wasteful annoyances. 9 By contrast, some
might see the posting of such messages as simply another way to "participate
directly in the rulemaking process"'--expression at the core of the APA's
purposes.
This Comment suggests a novel, middle course: a "two-track" e-comment
system that would distinguish substantive, unique messages on one hand and
bare expressions of preference on the other. This bifurcation, in turn, would yield
significant benefits for the notice-and-comment process.
The remainder of this Comment proceeds as follows: Part I outlines the
mechanics of how this proposal would operate. Part 11 discusses the benefits that
this system would have over both the status quo and previous reform proposals.
Part 1II then addresses possible critiques of this approach, while Part IV offers a
brief conclusion.
I. Mechanics of the Two-Track System
The two-track system would operate as follows: when viewing a proposed
rule online, would-be posters would have two options: (1) a "comment track,"
and (2) a "preference track."
The first option, the comment track, would essentially use the current
system: on this track, posters with substantive, unique messages could offer full
written statements on any proposed rule. },

@article{Mckinley2016,
abstract = {Contrary to popular opinion, the Supreme Court has not yet resolved whether lobbying is constitutionally protected. Belying this fact, courts, Congress, and scholars mistakenly assume that lobbying is protected under the Petition Clause. Because scholars have shared the mistaken assumption that the Petition Clause protects the practice of “lobbying”, no research to date has looked closely at the Petition Clause doctrine and the history of petitioning in relation to lobbying. In a recent opinion addressing petitioning in another context, the Supreme Court unearthed the long history behind the right to petition and argued for the importance of this history for future interpretation of the Petition Clause.

Following the Supreme Court's direction, this Article examines the implications of the history of petitioning for lobbying and, drawing from recent empirical research on lobbying, argues that the way Congress engages with the public through our current lobbying system actually violates the right to petition. At the Founding, and for much of this Nation's history, the right of petition protected a formal, transparent platform for individual — and, in particular, minority — voices to participate in the lawmaking process. Without regard to the number of signers or the political power of the petitioner, petitions received equal process and consideration. This platform allowed both the enfranchised and unenfranchised to gain access to lawmakers on equal footing. Women, African Americans, and Native Americans all engaged in petitioning activity, and Congress attended to each equally.

Moving beyond ahistorical, decontextualized interpretations of the Petition Clause, this Article posits that our current lobbying system — wherein access and procedure are informal, opaque, and based on political power — actually violates the right to petition, which provided access and formal procedure without respect to the political power of the petitioner. The history of petitioning teaches that affording access to the lawmaking process on the basis of an individual's political power makes as little sense as affording access to courts on such a basis.

This history suggests the need for revisiting the Petition Clause doctrine. On the one hand, it argues for a stronger petition right, especially a right to consideration and response. On the other hand, it suggests a narrowed petition right that protects only practices that correspond with the traditional practice of petitioning. Fundamentally, this Article demonstrates that a contextualized understanding of the Petition Clause, grounded in an accurate historical frame, requires comprehensive reform of our lobbying system and a formalization of the petition process in order to preserve our republican form of government.

Final version of the article now available. This article is part of a much larger project on lobbying and petitioning, however, so feedback is still quite welcome: mmckinley (at) law (dot) harvard (dot) edu.

@article{Selin2015,
abstract = {The responsiveness of government agencies to elected officials is a central question in democratic governance. A key source of variation in responsiveness is agency structure. Yet scholars often view agencies as falling into broad structural categories (e.g., cabinet departments or independent commissions) or fixate on some features of design (e.g., " for cause " protections). I develop new estimates of structural independence based on new data on 50 different structural features of 321 federal agencies in the federal executive establishment. Using a Bayesian latent variable model, I estimate independence on two dimensions: limits on the appointment of key agency decision makers and limits on political review of agency policy. I illustrate the value of this new measure by using it to examine how structure affects political influence and how agency independence can vary over time. I n 1933, President Roosevelt asked William E. Humphrey, a federal trade commissioner, for his resignation from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Roosevelt felt the " aims and purposes of the Administration with respect to the work of the Com-mission [could] be carried out most effectively " with Roosevelt-appointed commissioners as opposed to com-missioners whose terms carried over from the Hoover administration. 1 Humphrey declined to resign, and Pres-ident Roosevelt subsequently fired him. A lawsuit ensued, making its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. After hearing the case in 1935, the Court held that appointees at the head of agencies structured like the FTC are protected from removal by the president for political reasons. Since this decision, scholars have focused on indepen-dent regulatory commissions as a special type of agency and generally view independence in terms of whether an agency is structured like the FTC—a body with multi-ple members who serve fixed terms and are protected from removal but for cause (e.g., Breger and Edles 2000; Bressman and Thompson 2010; Lewis 2003; Verkuil 1988; Wood and Waterman 1991). Yet many other structural features insulate agencies from political influence. In fo-cusing on the three distinct legal features of independent commissions, we have limited our understanding of how agencies vary across the bureaucracy, and we have failed},

abstract = {Research on political communication effects has enjoyed great progress over the past 25 years. A key ingredient underlying these advances is the increased usage of experiments that demonstrate how communications influence opinions and behaviors. Virtually all of these studies pay scant attention to events that occur prior to the experiment—that is, in “pretreatment events.” In this article, we explore how and when the pretreatment environment affects experimental outcomes. We present two studies—one where we control the pretreatment environment and one where it naturally occurred—to show how pretreatment effects can influence experimental outcomes. We argue that, under certain conditions, attending to pretreatment dynamics leads to novel insights, including a more accurate portrait of the pliability of the mass public and the identification of potentially two groups of citizens—what we call malleability reactive and dogmatic.

abstract = {It is a brute fact of contemporary globalization?unmistakable as activists and journalists catalog scandal after scandal?that the very transformations making possible higher quality, cheaper products often lead to unacceptable conditions of work: brutal use of child labor, dangerous environments, punishingly long days, starvation wages, discrimination, suppression of expression and association. In all quarters, the question is not whether to address these conditions, but how. 

That question, however, admits no easy answers. Globalization itself has freed capital from many of its former constraints?national workplace standards, collective bargaining, and supervisory state agencies and courts?designed to humanize working conditions. A natural response, best expressed in the ILO's core labor standards, has been to attempt to build global versions of national institutions by establishing universal minimum standards of work and international inspectorates and courts to monitor and enforce them. But the machinery to compel global producers to adopt those standards does not exist and will be quite difficult to build. Alternatively, some multinational corporations and non-governmental organizations have struck out on their own, agreeing voluntarily to adopt various codes of conduct and allowing outsiders to verify compliance with these codes. In some cases these efforts have yielded impressive gains. But their piecemeal character highlights the difficulties of generalizing independent monitoring into an encompassing labor regulation regime. 

In this paper, we develop a third approach that attempts to harness some of the drivers and methods of contemporary globalization to the goal of improving international labor practices. An on-going globalization of information flows and advocacy campaigns around labor and human rights issues has successfully pressured a number of firms to significantly alter their production practices and labor conditions. Leading firms in the world economy, who have mastered the disciplines that foster excellence and innovation among their own workers and suppliers globally, are being motivated to turn these practices to social concerns. The impressive gains that have been achieved in product quality, diversity, price, and innovation in global markets, can, we assert, be extended to focus these disciplines on the improvement of labor and environmental conditions, and social performance more generally. We offer "Ratcheting Labor Standards" (RLS) as a regulatory strategy that does just this; rather than devising institutions that attempt to constrain the rapidly changing forces and processes of globalization, RLS attempts to redirect some of these energies toward the advancement of social ends.},

The author conducted a field experiment in Benin to investigate the impact of clientelism on voting behavior. In collaboration with four political parties involved in the 2001 presidential elections, clientelist and broad public policy platforms were designed and run in twenty randomly selected villages of an average of 756 registered voters. Using the survey data collected after the elections, the author estimated the effect of each type of message by comparing voting behavior in the villages exposed to clientelism or public policy messages (treatment groups) with voting behavior in the other villages (control groups). The author found that clientelist messages have positive and significant effect in all regions and for all types of candidates. The author also found that public policy messages have a positive and significant effect in the South but a negative and significant effect in the North. In addition, public policy messages seem to hurt incumbents as well as regional candidates. Finally, the evidence indicates that female voters tend to have stronger preference for public policy platforms than male voters.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Sinclair2012,
abstract = {Interpersonal communication presents a methodological challenge and a research opportunity for researchers involved in field experiments. The challenge is that communication among subjects blurs the line between treatment and control conditions. When treatment effects are transmitted from subject to subject, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) is violated, and comparison of treatment and control outcomes may provide a biased assessment of the treatment's causal influence. Social scientists are increasingly interested in the substantive phenomena that lead to SUTVA violations, such as communication in advance of an election. Experimental designs that gauge SUTVA violations provide useful insights into the extent and influence of interpersonal communication. This article illustrates the value of one such design, a multilevel experiment in which treatments are randomly assigned to individuals and varying proportions of their neighbors. After describing the theoretical and statistical underpinnings of this design, we apply it to a large‐scale voter‐mobilization experiment conducted in Chicago during a special election in 2009 using social‐pressure mailings that highlight individual electoral participation. We find some evidence of within‐household spillovers but no evidence of spillovers across households. We conclude by discussing how multilevel designs might be employed in other substantive domains, such as the study of deterrence and policy diffusion.

abstract = {This paper traces the course of inquiry on the U.S. Congress from 1945 to the present day, noting antecedents in the work of Woodrow Wilson, and through Wilson, of Walter Bagehot. Since 1945, the study of Congress has gone through an anglophile responsible-party phase, championed especially byWilliamYandell Elliott at Harvard, followed by a sociologically oriented legislative-behavior phase, identified in one generation with Lewis Anthony Dexter, Stephen K. Bailey, David Truman, and especially Ralph K. Huitt atWisconsin, and in the next generation with Richard Fenno, Charles O. Jones, Donald R. Matthews, and H. Douglas Price, among others. A third, contemporary intellectual orientation is identified most strongly with rational choice scholars, especially from the University of Rochester. The agenda of political science is formed not only by the literature but by events. Hence, the congressional reforms of the 1970s were influential in shaping the literature, as were such organizational innovations as the Congressional Fellowship Program and the Study of Congress, both projects of the American Political Science Association.

From Duplicate 2 (Landmarks in the Study of Congress since 1945 - Polsby, Nelson W; Schickler, Eric)

Polsby and Schickler 2002 
{\textperiodcentered}Interesting how few of the studies mentioned focus on the relationship between congress and other actors other than Fenno on interest groups and voters and Jones on separation of powers 
{\textperiodcentered}￼ 
o Numerous individual studies of work groups within Congress, notably com- mittees (Peabody 1963, Robinson 1963, Manley 1970, Fenno 1966) and state delegations [Truman 1959, Fiellen 1962, Deckard (Sinclair) 1972], and in studies of the politics of internal management, especially narratives describing party leadership struggles and the strategic principles that domi- nated these significant events (especially “inside” versus “outside” strategies) (Polsby 1963, Peabody 1976). 
o information could be considered in the aggre- gate or by tracking the performance of individuals, and could be used not only to monitor policy outcomes but also to follow the decision making (or cue-taking) of individual members (see Kingdon 1973, Matthews {\&} Stimson 1975). 
o Mayhew 1966), a highly creative roll-call study. Mayhew demonstrated that Democrats and Republicans behave differently toward the interest groups that make up their core constituencies. Democrats, he found, always vote to sustain their constituent interests; Republicans tend to vote on principled grounds even against their constituents and allies. 
o Congress: The Electoral Connection (1974),17 Mayhew executed one of the first—and still one of the best—rational choice studies of Congress, par- simoniously asking how members would logically behave if they were obsessed only with the goal of assuring their reelection. He deduces that in such circum- stances, members would do a lot of what we observe them doing: position-taking, credit-claiming, and advertising. The assumption of pure reelection-mindedness yields less-good predictions 
o Three themes have emerged as particularly sig- nificant in the ensuing decades. First, scholars have devoted considerable energy to understanding the major reforms adopted by Congress in the 1970s. Both the reform era itself and the contours of the so-called “post-reform” Congress have been major topics of debate. Second, the rise of rational choice approaches in the discipline at large has sparked a new focus on the design and effects of legis- lative institutions. Scholars ask to what extent congressional organization serves the interests of three sorts of aggregated actors: cross-party distributive coalitions, the majority party, and floor majorities. A major animating issue has been whether the majority party is able to use its agenda control to pull policy outcomes toward the party median and away from the median of the whole House. Third, histori- cally oriented scholars have traced changes in congressional institutions over time, 
{\textperiodcentered}Debate over “whethere parties matter “ Kreible vs Cox and McCubbins – and other narrow questions and narrow methods dominated 90s and 2000s – Poole and Rosenthall roll call was the only data out there - got a bad rap as very boring, not answering big questions—new data, new questions, (eg expierements)—more types of info (scraping data)—pluralism of approach},

abstract = {Literature on private regulation recognizes the proliferation of competing regulatory organizations and approaches in various industries. Studies analyzing why fragmentation arises so far focus on single-case studies, the exploration of single variables, or variation in types of fragmentation. This article analyzes why in certain industries and for certain issues regulatory organizations proliferate, while in others a single regulatory organization emerges which covers the entire industry. Through a comparative case study of private regulation of sustainability standards in the forestry, clothing, IT-electronics, and chemicals industries, we show how a combination of low industrial concentration, civil society involvement in governance, and stringent standards of a first-moving regulator offer the strongest explanation for a fragmented private regulatory field, while high industrial concentration, business-driven governance, and lenient standards of a first-moving regulator lead to cohesive regulation.

abstract = {Recent years have seen a renaissance of conjoint survey designs within social science. To date, however, researchers have lacked guidance on how many attributes they can include within conjoint profiles before survey satisficing leads to unacceptable declines in response quality. This paper addresses that question using pre-registered, two-stage experiments examining choices among hypothetical candidates for U.S. Senate or hotel rooms. In each experiment, we use the first stage to identify attributes which are perceived to be uncorrelated with the attribute of interest — and so cannot be masked by those core attributes. In the second stage, we randomly assign respondents to conjoint designs with varying numbers of those filler attributes. We report the results of these experiments implemented via Amazon's Mechanical Turk or Survey Sampling International. They demonstrate that our core quantities of interest are generally stable, with relatively modest increases in survey satisficing when respondents face large numbers of attributes.

I have not read the Collins (2008) study, cited in Black and Owens (2009), that found that amicus briefs were poor proxies for political salience. This may be true, but this measure may also be correlated with distance between the likely outcome and the status quo (as benefits rise, more groups will be willing to bear participation costs).

Black and Owens have several clever ways of measuring their variables which lend themselves to slightly different interpretations, including in the 2012 PRQ piece.
What Black and Owens really measure is whether justices grant cert when the JSC scores of the referring court (“status quo”) are closer to them than JCS of the median justice (“merits outcome”). 
That judges prefer cases when the status quo is more distant than the outcome of the case is the same as saying “justices are less likely to review decisions made by ideological allies than those by ideological foes” (Black and Owens 2012)
Status quo seems like a sensible interpretation of the referring court's JSC, but “ideological allies” is more intuitive. Predicted “merits outcome” imperfectly resonates with the concept of merits. Perhaps “pure policy outcome” would be better. Deciding on the merits evokes case-specific considerations that do exclude legal considerations around granting cert, but seem to be more than just policy considerations. For example, it seems that granting cert so that the court can exclude a class from standing would would here be considered ‘merits,' but Rowland and Todd would consider this procedural gatekeeping. 
Do the Black and Owens (2009) findings hold up if controlling for ideological composition of the referring court? If not, this might suggest there is more of a social factors more than a legal+strategic factors are driving the results. Black and Owens (2012) interpret their findings “conservative justices might be less likely to audit liberal lower court decisions adopted by conservative judges“ as evidence of justices receiving a signal of the “right” legal outcome. A cynic could similarly read this as signaling ‘unfriendly facts.' However, this could also be evidence of social drivers—who wants to overrule their friends? It makes for awkward cocktail parties. Could this model be improved by adding a measure of social distance as well as ideological distance—perhaps citations or common organizational affiliations.},

@article{Habyarimana2007,
abstract = {A large and growing literature links high levels of ethnic diversity to low levels of public goods provision. Yet although the empirical connection between ethnic heterogeneity and the underprovision of public goods is widely accepted, there is little consensus on the specific mechanisms through which this relationship operates. We identify three families of mechanisms that link diversity to public goods provision—what we term “preferences,” “technology,” and “strategy selection” mechanisms—and run a series of experimental games that permit us to compare the explanatory power of distinct mechanisms within each of these three families. Results from games conducted with a random sample of 300 subjects from a slum neighborhood of Kampala, Uganda, suggest that successful public goods provision in homogenous ethnic communities can be attributed to a strategy selection mechanism: in similar settings, co-ethnics play cooperative equilibria, whereas non-co-ethnics do not. In addition, we find evidence for a technology mechanism: co-ethnics are more closely linked on social networks and thus plausibly better able to support cooperation through the threat of social sanction. We find no evidence for prominent preference mechanisms that emphasize the commonality of tastes within ethnic groups or a greater degree of altruism toward co-ethnics, and only weak evidence for technology mechanisms that focus on the impact of shared ethnicity on the productivity of teams.

abstract = {Universities require faculty and students planning research involving human subjects to pass formal certification tests and then submit research plans for prior approval. Those who diligently take the tests may better understand certain important legal requirements but, at the same time, are often misled into thinking they can apply these rules to their own work which, in fact, they are not permitted to do. They will also be missing many other legal requirements not mentioned in their training but which govern their behaviors. Finally, the training leaves them likely to completely misunderstand the essentially political situation they find themselves in. The resulting risks to their universities, collaborators, and careers may be catastrophic, in addition to contributing to the more common ordinary frustrations of researchers with the system. To avoid these problems, faculty and students conducting research about and for the public need to understand that they are public figures, to whom different rules apply, ones that political scientists have long studied. University administrators (and faculty in their parttime roles as administrators) need to reorient their perspectives as well. University research compliance bureaucracies have grown, in wellmeaning but sometimes unproductive ways that are not required by federal laws or guidelines. We offer advice to faculty and students for how to deal with the system as it exists now, and suggestions for changes in university research compliance bureaucracies, that should benefit faculty, students, staff, university budgets, and our research subjects.},

We present two concrete use cases involving key techniques in the NLP domain for which we show that reproduc-ing results is still difficult. We show that the deviation that can be found in repro-duction efforts leads to questions about how our results should be interpreted. Moreover, investigating these deviations provides new insights and a deeper under-standing of the examined techniques. We identify five aspects that can influence the outcomes of experiments that are typically not addressed in research papers. Our use cases show that these aspects may change the answer to research questions leading us to conclude that more care should be taken in interpreting our results and more research involving systematic testing of methods is required in our field.},

abstract = {Keiser and Soss analyze the use of “good cause” exemptions in child support enforcement programs to test their hypothesis that the use of these exemptions will vary systematically across states depending on the internal characteristics of state bureaucracies. In their view “policy implementation represents a continuation o f the political process- a form of policy making by other means (1133).” They find that the implementation of this federal policy has devolved into a patchwork that varies significantly depending on the political conditions in the state. Additionally, this work has important implications for the reality faced by street level bureaucrats when attempting to implement federal policy. Often, the politics of client benefits is only exacerbated once the policy implementation phase begins. Their analysis shows the importance of clear legislative mandates; absent such a mandate policy will be “shaped by partisan control of state governments, by the values of the state bureaucracy, by the funding decisions of elected officials, and by the levels of demand placed on t he bureaucracy (1152).”},

abstract = {In order to address classic questions about democratic representation in countries with winner-take-all electoral districts, it is necessary to understand the distribution of political preferences across districts. Re-cent formal theory literature has contributed new insights into how par-ties choose platforms in countries with a continuum of heterogeneous districts. Meanwhile, increases in survey sample sizes and advances in empirical techniques have made it possible to characterize the distri-bution of preferences within and across electoral districts. This review addresses an emerging literature that builds on these new tools to ex-plore the ways in which the geography of political preferences can help explain the parties that compete, the platforms and policies they choose, and even the rules under which they compete. Building on insights from economic and political geography, it pays special attention to electoral and policy biases that can emerge when there is an asymmetric distri-bution of preferences across districts.},

abstract = {Policy makers in the US federal government regularly consult advisory committees, but there is little systematic research on how committee advice influences executive branch policy making. We investigate the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) use of advisory committees when deciding whether or not to approve pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices for marketing. Specifically, using 1997-2006 drug and device approval data, we estimate the influence of committee advice on FDA decision making. We find that an increase in the proportion of committee members voting for drug approval increases the probability of FDA approval and that an increase in the proportion of committee members voting for approval reduces the time it takes for the FDA to approve a drug or device application after committee consultation. Additionally, for theoretical and empirical reasons, our analysis explores the FDA's decision to consult advisory committees and its concern about the delay that committee consultation might introduce. Although data limitations enable us to explore these latter issues with respect to approved applications only, our study has some implications for scholarship on committee consultation, bureaucratic delay, and political control.},

abstract = {We develop a computer-assisted method for the discovery of insightful conceptualizations, in the form of clusterings (i.e., partitions) of input objects. Each of the numerous fully automated methods of cluster analysis proposed in statistics, computer science, and biology optimize a different objective function. Almost all are well defined, but how to determine before the fact which one, if any, will partition a given set of objects in an "insightful" or "useful" way for a given user is unknown and difficult, if not logically impossible. We develop a metric space of partitions from all existing cluster analysis methods applied to a given dataset (along with millions of other solutions we add based on combinations of existing clusterings) and enable a user to explore and interact with it and quickly reveal or prompt useful or insightful conceptualizations. In addition, although it is uncommon to do so in unsupervised learning problems, we offer and implement evaluation designs that make our computer-assisted approach vulnerable to being proven suboptimal in specific data types. We demonstrate that our approach facilitates more efficient and insightful discovery of useful information than expert human coders or many existing fully automated methods.},

However, while the discourse on content analysis cen-ters heavily on reproducibility, computer sci-entists often focus more on scalability and less on coding reliability, leading to growing skep-ticism on the usefulness of topic models for automated content analysis. In response, we introduce TopicCheck, an interactive tool for assessing topic model stability. Our contri-butions are threefold. First, from established guidelines on reproducible content analysis, we distill a set of design requirements on how to computationally assess the stability of an automated coding process. Second, we devise an interactive alignment algorithm for match-ing latent topics from multiple models, and en-able sensitivity evaluation across a large num-ber of models. Finally, we demonstrate that our tool enables social scientists to gain novel insights into three active research questions.},

abstract = {Does external monitoring improve democratic performance? Fact-checking has come to play an increasingly important role in political coverage in the United States, but some research suggests it may be ineffective at reducing public misperceptions about controversial issues. However, fact-checking might instead help improve political discourse by increasing the reputational costs or risks of spreading misinformation for political elites. To evaluate this deterrent hypothesis, we conducted a field experiment on a diverse group of state legislators from nine U.S. states in the months before the November 2012 election. In the experiment, a randomly assigned subset of state legislators was sent a series of letters about the risks to their reputation and electoral security if they were caught making questionable statements. The legislators who were sent these letters were substantially less likely to receive a negative fact-checking rating or to have their accuracy questioned publicly, suggesting that fact-checking can reduce inaccuracy when it poses a salient threat. T o what extent can external monitoring increase political accountability and improve democratic outcomes? Social scientists are increasingly using field experiments to understand the ways in which monitoring can shape political and bureaucratic behavior (e.g., Butler 2010; Duflo, Hanna, and Rya 2012; Ferraz and Finan 2008; Grose n.d.; Humphreys and Weinstein n.d.; Malesky, Schuler, and Tran 2012; Olken 2007). One important source of external monitoring for politicians in free societies is the press. In the United States, several fact-checking organizations have begun to systematically evaluate the accuracy of statements made by politicians at the national and state level using a journalistic approach (Graves and Glaisyer 2012), but little systematic evidence exists on the consequences of this practice. Among the mass public, the evidence is mixed on whether fact-checking improves citizens' political knowledge. Some studies suggest that it can be effective. For instance, Pingree, Brossard, and McLeod (2014) show that journalistic adjudication of factual disputes Brendan Nyhan is Assistant Professor,},

abstract = {A first step in identifying the content of a document is determining which topics that document addresses. We describe a generative model for documents, introduced by Blei, Ng, and Jordan [Blei, D. M., Ng, A. Y. {\&} Jordan, M. I. (2003) J. Machine Learn. Res. 3, 993-1022], in which each document is generated by choosing a distribution over topics and then choosing each word in the document from a topic selected according to this distribution. We then present a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference in this model. We use this algorithm to analyze abstracts from PNAS by using Bayesian model selection to establish the number of topics. We show that the extracted topics capture meaningful structure in the data, consistent with the class designations pro-vided by the authors of the articles, and outline further applica-tions of this analysis, including identifying ''hot topics'' by exam-ining temporal dynamics and tagging abstracts to illustrate semantic content. W hen scientists decide to write a paper, one of the first things they do is identify an interesting subset of the many possible topics of scientific investigation. The topics addressed by a paper are also one of the first pieces of information a person tries to extract when reading a scientific abstract. Scientific experts know which topics are pursued in their field, and this information plays a role in their assessments of whether papers are relevant to their interests, which research areas are rising or falling in popularity, and how papers relate to one another. Here, we present a statistical method for automatically extracting a representation of documents that provides a first-order approx-imation to the kind of knowledge available to domain experts. Our method discovers a set of topics expressed by documents, providing quantitative measures that can be used to identify the content of those documents, track changes in content over time, and express the similarity between documents. We use our method to discover the topics covered by papers in PNAS in a purely unsupervised fashion and illustrate how these topics can be used to gain insight into some of the structure of science. The statistical model we use in our analysis is a generative model for documents; it reduces the complex process of pro-ducing a scientific paper to a small number of simple probabi-listic steps and thus specifies a probability distribution over all possible documents. Generative models can be used to postulate complex latent structures responsible for a set of observations, making it possible to use statistical inference to recover this structure. This kind of approach is particularly useful with text, where the observed data (the words) are explicitly intended to communicate a latent structure (their meaning). The particular generative model we use, called Latent Dirichlet Allocation, was introduced in ref. 1. This generative model postulates a latent structure consisting of a set of topics; each document is produced by choosing a distribution over topics, and then generating each word at random from a topic chosen by using this distribution. The plan of this article is as follows. In the next section, we describe Latent Dirichlet Allocation and present a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference in this model, illustrating the operation of our algorithm on a small dataset. We then apply our algorithm to a corpus consisting of abstracts from PNAS from 1991 to 2001, determining the number of topics needed to account for the information contained in this corpus and ex-tracting a set of topics. We use these topics to illustrate the relationships between different scientific disciplines, assessing trends and ''hot topics'' by analyzing topic dynamics and using the assignments of words to topics to highlight the semantic content of documents.},

The electoral connection causes marginal representatives—legislators with districts composed of the other party's partisans—to emphasize appropriations in their home styles. But it causes aligned representatives—those with districts filled with copartisans—to build their home styles around position taking. Aggregated across representatives, this results in an artificial polarization in stated party positions: aligned representatives, who tend to be ideologically extreme, dominate policy debates. The logic and evidence in this article provide an explanation for the apparent rise in vitriolic debate, and the new measures facilitate a literature on home styles.},

Abstract Statistical models of text have become increasingly popular in statistics and com-puter science as a method of exploring large document collections. Social scientists often want to move beyond exploration, to measurement and experimentation, and make inference about social and political processes that drive discourse and content. In this paper, we develop a model of text data that supports this type of substantive research. Our approach is to posit a hierarchical mixed membership model for an-alyzing topical content of documents, in which mixing weights are parameterized by observed covariates. In this model, topical prevalence and topical content are spec-ified as a simple generalized linear model on an arbitrary number of document-level covariates, such as news source and time of release, enabling researchers to introduce elements of the experimental design that informed document collection into the model, within a generally applicable framework. We demonstrate the proposed methodology by analyzing a collection of news reports about China, where we allow the prevalence of topics to evolve over time and vary across newswire services. Our methods quantify the effect of news wire source on both the frequency and nature of topic coverage.},

Researchers seek to study not only whether one variable affects another but also how such a causal relationship arises. Yet commonly used statistical methods for identifying causal mechanisms rely upon untestable assumptions and are often inappropriate even under those assumptions. Randomizing treatment and intermediate variables is also insufficient. Despite these difficulties, the study of causal mechanisms is too important to abandon. We make three contributions to improve research on causal mechanisms. First, we present a minimum set of assumptions required under standard designs of experimental and observational studies and develop a general algorithm for estimating causal mediation effects. Second, we provide a method for assessing the sensitivity of conclusions to potential violations of a key assumption. Third, we offer alternative research designs for identifying causal mechanisms under weaker assumptions. The proposed approach is illustrated using media framing experiments and incumbency advantage studies.},

abstract = {The validity of empirical research often relies upon the accuracy of self-reported behavior and beliefs. Yet eliciting truthful answers in surveys is challenging, especially when studying sensitive issues such as racial prejudice, corruption, and support for militant groups. List experiments have attracted much attention recently as a potential solution to this measurement problem. Many researchers, however, have used a simple difference-in-means estimator, which prevents the efficient examination of multivariate relationships between respondents' characteristics and their responses to sensitive items. Moreover, no systematic means exists to investigate the role of underlying assumptions. We fill these gaps by developing a set of new statistical methods for list experiments. We identify the commonly invoked assumptions, propose new multivariate regression estimators, and develop methods to detect and adjust for potential violations of key assumptions. For empirical illustration, we analyze list experiments concerning racial prejudice. Open-source software is made available to implement the proposed methodology.},

Although there are abundant opinions about the magnitude, direction, and even existence of media bias, producing a scholarly consensus on the issue has proven difficult for several reasons. In particular, scholars studying media bias empirically must over- come problems of subjectivity, strategic behavior by the actors involved in the process, and especially the absence of suitable baselines against which to assess bias. This article reviews some approaches to studying media bias and explores several promising strategies and tools scholars have developed to help overcome these obstacles.

@article{Slapin2008,
abstract = {Recent advances in computational content analysis have provided scholars promising new ways for estimating party positions. However, existing text-based methods face challenges in producing valid and reliable time-series data. This article proposes a scaling algorithm called WORDFISH to estimate policy positions based on word frequencies in texts. The technique allows researchers to locate parties in one or multiple elections. We demonstrate the algorithm by estimating the positions of German political parties from 1990 to 2005 using word frequencies in party manifestos. The extracted positions reflect changes in the party system more accurately than existing time-series estimates. In addition, the method allows researchers to examine which words are important for placing parties on the left and on the right. We find that words with strong political connotations are the best discriminators between parties. Finally, a series of robustness checks demonstrate that the estimated positions are insensitive to distributional assumptions and document selection. M any theories of comparative politics rely on the ability of researchers to locate political parties in a policy space. Theories of coalition forma-tion and duration use party positions to predict which governments form and how long they survive (Baron 1991; Crombez 1996; de Swaan 1973; Druckman and Thies 2002; Druckman, Martin, and Thies 2005; Strom 1984; Warwick 1992). Likewise, theories of lawmaking use distances between parties to predict policy change (Bawn 1999; Hallerberg and Basinger 1998; Tsebelis 2002), as do analyses of budgetary politics (Franzese 2002), globaliza-tion and the social welfare state (Garrett 1998), and labor politics (Wallerstein 1999). In fact, all tests of spatial mod-els in comparative politics rely on the ability to estimate party positions. Despite the importance of party positions to the study of comparative politics, locating parties in a po-litical space over time is a difficult task. Although one might have a good intuition about where parties stand relative to each other, the positions themselves are ab-stract concepts that cannot be observed directly (Benoit and Laver 2006b, chap. 3).

@article{Hanna2013,
abstract = {With the emergence of the Arab Spring and the Occupy movements, interest in the study of movements that use the Internet and social networking sites has grown exponentially. However, our inability to easily and cheaply analyze the large amount of content these move-ments produce limits our study of them. This article attempts to address this methodological lacuna by detailing procedures for collecting data from Facebook and presenting a class of computer-aided content analysis methods. I apply one of these methods in the analysis of mobilization patterns of Egypt's April 6 youth movement. I corroborate the method with in-depth interviews from movement participants. I conclude by discussing the difficulties and pitfalls of using this type of data in content analysis and in using automated methods for coding textual data in multiple languages. Contemporary movements almost invariably incorporate online tools into their tactical repertoires. Although high-profile cases such as the 2011 Egyptian revolution and Occupy Wall Street have garnered the most attention, some of the fundamental work of movement activists—coordination, persuasion, and discussion—has been facilitated by the integration of social media and other information and communication technologies (ICTs). Accordingly, movement scholars are turning their focus to ICTs to better understand what is happening in these spaces and to incorporate them into the existing social movement literature. Social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter provide us with the ability to observe what an activist or a would-be activist is saying and doing as an instance of contention unfolds. Their profile characteristics display relevant information about them, their utterances suggest partic-ular courses of action, and the connections they make with others highlight the networked nature of these sites. At the same time, the data available to researchers studying these movements have far surpassed the amount that had been previously available for analysis. The sheer scale of these data could give us unprecedented leverage in answering questions about social movement activity. While many studies of mobilization with ICTs have been studied in terms of network structure and message volume, most have neglected to focus on the content of messages at scale. These data can be better leveraged with computer-aided content analysis methods that can classify message content. {\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}},

{\S}“(a) that monoliths are black bozxs covering various gears and levers in a highly differentiated decision-making structure, and (b) that large acts are the consequences of innumerable and often conflicting smaller actions by individuals at various levels 
{\S}“a conglomerate of semi-feudal, loosely allied organizations, each with a substantial life of its own” 
{\S}“output reflects the independent output of several organizations, partially coordinated by government leaders” 
{\S}Unit of analysis: policy as org output 
{\S}Individual actions at different levels (e.g. soldiers operating on rutines set by military 
{\'{u}} Affected by selective info available to the org, recruitiment of personnel, tenure of individuals, group pressures within, distribution of rewards, cliants / interest groups, government allies etc 
{\'{u}} Action as organizational output – action in any particular case is a function of pre-established routines 
{\'{u}} Goals: always in conflict 
{\'{u}} Standard Operating Proceedures; orgs higher functions are functions of lower level activities such as forming budgets, reports, etc 
{\'{u}} Org coordinates indiv actions (e.g. CIA and Air Force over cuba 
{\textperiodcentered}Details of air strike deligated to air force 
{\'{u}} Negotiated environment creates regular responces (orgs do not estimate the probability dist of responces) 
{\S}Pg 701 difficult for political leaders to get what they want out of organizations (principle agent / autonomy) 
{\S}INFERNCE PATTERN 
{\'{u}} If an org performs and action, its components must have been performing a similar action (or had established routines for it) yesterday 
{\'{u}} The best predictor of t is t-1 
{\'{u}} Uncovering the org routines that explain puzzeling behavior 
{\'{u}} Propositions: 
{\textperiodcentered}Action is not far-sighted or flexible 
{\textperiodcentered}Particular instances that do not fit well with normal stimuli, the programs are ill-suited for dealing with it 
{\textperiodcentered}Feasibility gap between what leaders choose or might choose and what is implemented 
{\textperiodcentered}Orgs are blunt, projects requiring high-level of precision or coordination may fail 
{\textperiodcentered}Projects that demand departure from normal functions are rarely accomplished 
{\textperiodcentered}Leaders expect each org will do its part (what it knows how to do) 
{\textperiodcentered}Leaders should expect incompletete information from each part 
{\textperiodcentered}Where work is contrary to the existing goals of the org, resistance 
{\'{u}} Org constraints (e..g full mobilization vs. no mobilization, partial is not an organizational option) 
o Bureaucratic Politics Model (Model III) (see Neustadt on presidential) 
{\S}Outcomes of various overlapping bargaining games among players hierarchically arranged (claims Huntington's conception of politics as legislative ignores hierarchal structure of the game) 
{\S}Game theory (see Wittgenstein and Schelling) 
{\'{u}} Perceptions, motivations, positions, power, maneuvers – SEEMS BROADER THAN MODERN GAME THEORY - BARGAINING MAY INCLUDE PERSUASION? 
{\'{u}} Power = bargaining advantages (authority, institutional backing ,constituents, expertise, status), skill and will to use advantages, and other players perceptions 
{\S}Leaders of orgs are not a monolithic group: share power 
{\S}Barginaning along regular channels – power and skill of proponents of different actions 
{\'{u}} Structured processes; e.g. budgeting [SIMILAR TO ORG (ORG + RATIONAL?) 
{\'{u}} “requires some understanding of the machine which is being influenced” pg 717 
{\S}Rather than outputs, outcomes of games 
{\S}Fundamental disagreements among reasonable men about what ought to be 
{\S}Deadlines force issues to the attention of busy players 
{\'{u}} “major problem is how to get the attention of Chiefs” 
{\'{u}} how to get commitment from coalition and confidence of above 
{\S}The core of b pol is personality” 
Sensitivities, priorities, debts, commitments – DO THE RIGHT THING – COMMITMENTS SEEM MORE THAN PREFRENCES 
“the most subtile and intricate probing, pulling, and hauling; leading, guiding, and spurring. Reconstruction of this process can only be tentative. INITIALLY the President and most of his advisers wanted the clean, surgical air strike.” PREFS CHANGE ! “frame the issue as strategic”- president did not buy it{\ldots}wanted “strong response” p 714 “arguments against the strike on moral grouns struck a chord in the President” THIS IS A HIGHLY NUANCED AND SOPHISTOCATED GAME 
“who supported” and “how they supported it, counted” TRUST AND COALITIONS 
misinformation was critical 
{\S}Answers to “what is the issue?' and “what must be done?” are colored by the position from wich the questions are considered” 
{\'{u}} Not the same perspective as analysists – focused on the individual consiquences 
{\'{u}} “strong advocates{\ldots}whose careers are closely identified with the war, rarely come to the conclusion that the costs outweight benefits” 
{\'{u}} “thous whose responsibilities sensitise the m to problems other than war{\ldots}.are convinced that the war effort is futile 
{\'{u}} surrender is likely to come as the result of a political shift that enhances the effective power of the latter group and adds members to it 
{\'{u}} “particular actions can influence the advantages and disadvantes of plauers in the other government 
{\textperiodcentered}Three questions: 
o 1. What pattern of outcomes could lead to x 
o 2. What stream of outcomes might lead to x, at what point is the org in that stream 
o 3. How migh miscalculation and confusion generate foul-ups that yield the outcomes},

abstract = {Discretion is fundamental to understanding inter-branch interactions in our sepa-ration of powers system. Yet, measuring discretion in order to test various theories of delegation is challenging. The few existing measures have difficulty capturing both delegations and constraints in a consistent way over time. In this paper, we seek to overcome these challenges by offering a novel measure of executive discretion based on legislative appropriations to all agencies, weighted by the spending limitations imposed on these agencies found within appropriations committee reports. We first validate this measure by using it to test the " ally principle, " finding that Congress gives greater discretion to agencies when ideologically aligned with the president. Further, we use our new measure to test additional discretion-based theories related to military combat, the " Two Presidencies, " and agency insulation. Overall, this measure can be used to evaluate other previously difficult to test theories of policymaking.},

abstract = {Against the backdrop of Ferguson and the Black Lives Matter movement, we ask what the American politics subfield has to say about the political lives of communities subjugated by race and class. We argue that mainstream re- search in this subfield—framed by images of representative democracy and Marshallian citizenship—has provided a rich portrait of what such commu- nities lack in political life. Indeed, by focusing so effectively on their political marginalization, political scientists have ironically made such communities marginal to the subfield's account of American democracy and citizenship. In this article, we provide a corrective by focusing on what is present in the political lives of such communities. To redress the current imbalance and advance the understandings of race and class in American politics, we ar- gue that studies of the liberal-democratic “first face” of the state must be complemented by greater attention to the state's more controlling “second face.” Focusing on policing, we seek to unsettle the mainstream of a subfield that rarely inquires into governmental practices of social control and the ways “race-class subjugated communities” are governed through coercion, containment, repression, surveillance, regulation, predation, discipline, and violence},

abstract = {The contributions to the volume present a challenge to conventional views on the extent and scope of globalization as well as to predictions of the imminent disappearance of the nation state's leverage over the economy. How does globalization change national economies and politics? Are rising levels of trade, capital flows, new communication technologies, and deregulation forcing all societies to converge toward the same structures of production and distribution? Suzanne Berger and Ronald Dore have brought together a distinguished group of experts to consider how the international economy shapes and transforms domestic structures. Drawing from experience in the United States, Europe, and Asia, the contributors ask whether competition, imitation, diffusion of best practice, trade, and financial flows are reducing national diversities. The authors seek to understand whether the sources of national political autonomy are undermined by changes in the international system. Can distinctive varieties of capitalism that incorporate unique and valued institutions for achieving social welfare survive in a global economy?

Dahl – Politics = who gets what and why? 
{\textperiodcentered}Court makes policy on margin, mostly confers legitimacy on ruling coalition, and, “at its best, upon the basic patterns of behavior required for the operation of a democracy” 
o Legal criteria are inadequate - Uncertain about consequences and preferences – must choose among controversial alternatives 
o If thought to be “political” no problem, but legitimacy rests on the fiction that it is not a political institution (IN THE FIGHTING MEANING OF POLITICAL, BUT IN THE POLICYMAKING MEANING?) 
o 2 crieria (1) majority (2) Justice 
{\S}majority – decision must favor a majority or minority over another – America is minorities rule country, bargaining, results in policy 
{\'{u}} striking a statute could be thought to be overruling a majority 
01. this would be to deny popular soveignty in America (100{\%} POP SOV, YES, THE WILL IS NEVER PERFECTLY CONSTITUTED AND REQUIRES JUDEMENT OF POLICYMAKERS + OLIGARCIC JUDGEMENT OF RIGHT---THIS WAS AN INTENTIONAL TENSION) 
02. except for new deal, courts generally overturn old legislation{\ldots}.meaning that they are responsive to ?legislative? Majorities? - Worst battle with legislator was over child labor laws, which the court blocked from 1916 to 1941 ={\textgreater}“lawmaking majorities gengerally have their way” - 29 
{\S}3 – Rights/Justice 
{\'{u}} norms of justice will generally be the same as other political elite 
{\'{u}} finds it implausible that court finds natural rights to employ child labor, be free from taxes and workmans comp{\ldots}.SO WHAT ARE THEY DOING? WAS IT NOT JUSTIFIED ON THE BASES OF THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT? 
{\'{u}} Court has upheld rights of privileged against rights of submerged groups – slaves and people of color WHAT ABOUT DOMA? 
o CONCLUSION: National politics in democracies is marked by coalitions that are stable over time- marked by break with past, struggle, consolidation, and decay 
{\S}Court is part of major coalition and powerless to affect the course of national policy 
{\S}It is an essential part of the coalition – unique legitimacy 
{\'{u}} Is jeopardized if goes against dominant alliance 
{\'{u}} Makes policy within limits like a powerful committee chairman 
{\'{u}} Not effective against current majority 
{\'{u}} Most effective in setting bounds (EVIDENCE?)},

First, we agree that for a political system to be viable, for it to succeed in per- forming tasks of authoritative resource allo- cation, problem solving, conflict settlement, and so on, in behalf of a population of any substantial size, it must be institutionalized. That is to say, organizations must be created and sustained that are specialized to political activity.' Otherwise, the political system is likely to be unstable, weak, and incapable of servicing the demands or protecting the in- terests of its constituent groups. Secondly, it is generally agreed that for a political system to be in some sense free and democratic, means must be found for institutionalizing representa- tiveness with all the diversity that this implies, and for legitimizing yet at the same time con- taining political opposition within the system.2},

abstract = {Key begins by noting that not all elections are the same, and sets out to examine the existence of elections in which the voters appear deeply involved, participatory, and result in a change in the cleavages within the electorate, termed a critical election. Key examines Massachusetts and New England election returns for the election of Al Smith in 1928, the first Catholic presidential nominee. He notes that this election was the flashpoint for a wide and new cleavage, examining the more immigrant-centered Somerville with the more rural Ashfield. He then replicates these results in the rest of the state and in the remaining New England states aggregating the towns or districts with the biggest Democratic gains against those with the smallest. What he finds is that these new coalitions began at a certain point and remained durable over his period of analysis, 1916 to 1952. He analyzes and finds similar results analyzing the data from Massachusetts by the size of the town, showing a sharp loss by the democratic party in all size towns between 1892 and 1896, and a gain of increasing magnitude by population for the Democrats between 1920 and 1928. He concludes by noting: The actual election rarely presents in pure form a case fitting completely any particular concept. Especially in a large and diverse electorate a single polling may encompass radically varying types of behavior among different categories of voters; yet a dominant characteristic often makes itself apparent.},

Based on a duration analysis of cases decided from the 1946 through 1995 terms, we show that ideological incongruence between a precedent and a subsequent Court increases the chance of it being overruled. Two legal norms also exert substantive effects as the Court is less likely to overrule statutory precedents and more likely to overrule precedents that previously have been interpreted negatively by the Court. While certain precedent characteristics also influence this decision, the political environ- ment exerts no such effect. Consequently, one of the principal implications of this research is that legal norms influence Supreme Court decision making.},

engaging with the bureaucracy. This behavior, which I call “backchannel policymaking”, is a
new way of thinking about policymaking and representational behavior, distinct from previously
studied channels of the lawmaking process like roll call votes or bill introductions. I develop and
test a theory to explain why members of Congress choose to engage with the bureaucracy. I
consider whether backchannel policymaking serves as an alternative path for policy influence, which members of Congress use to circumvent the legislative process. My analyses, which focus
on senators' policy contact with the bureaucracy during the 110th and the 111th Congresses and
draw on original bureaucratic records from the U.S. Departments of Labor and Homeland
Security, reveal that a senator's institutional position, constraints, and behavior within the
legislative process predict her engagement in backchannel policymaking. These findings
illustrate how members of Congress try to influence policy outside of the formal lawmaking
process.},

@book{Wilson1989,
abstract = {Wilson examines bureaucratic efficiency and capacity, and attempts to explain the agendas bureaucracies set out to realize and the constraints that hamper their ability to execute effectively. He outlines three primary constraints (Chapter 7) on bur eaucratic behavior: (1) they lack a profit maximizing incentive, since they are legally precluded from distributing profits to their clients; (2) they are unable to dynamically allocate resources to areas of greatest need or even greatest success; and fina lly (3) bureaucratic agencies serve goals that are not of their own choosing. Importantly, many of these constraints are not the result of internal failure but are imposed from external actors like Congress. This “red tape” is motivated by a desire to prevent agency misbehavior. Wilson concludes that these constraints lead to overly complex procedures and institutional rules, an incentive structure that aligns more closely with minimizing constraint violation than effective outcomes, and a proliferation of middle management who are incentivized to be risk averse and shy from innovation. As such, the inefficiency many experience in their interactions with bureaucracy isn't necessarily a result of agencies eager to assume an ever-increasing number of functions ; rather it is often their need to adhere to specific policy prescriptions that leads to inefficiency. Bureaucracy is the classic study of the way American government agencies work and how they can be made to work better. Examining a wide range of bureaucracies, including the Army, the FBI, the FCC, and the Social Security Administration, James Q. Wilson provides the first comprehensive, in-depth analysis of what government agencies do, why they function as they do, and how they might become more responsible and effective.

However, the role of private authority in the regime complex – situations where non-state actors set rules or standards that other actors adopt – has only recently received academic attention. In this article, we ‘unbundle' the concept of the regime complex in two novel ways. Firstly, we argue that an accurate depiction of any regime complex must also include private authority. Secondly, using examples from environmental governance, we carefully elaborate four specific mechanisms through which public and private authority interact, demonstrating the ways in which private authority can improve the problem-solving capacity of regime complexes. In short, a full understanding of the contributions of private authority to solving environmental problems requires examining its interactions with public rules and institutions.},

@article{MatthewDesmond2014,
abstract = {All matters related to ethnography flow from a decision that originates at the very beginning of the research process—the selection of the basic object of analysis— and yet fieldworkers pay scant attention to this crucial task. As a result, most take as their starting point bounded entities delimited by location or social classification and in so doing restrict the kinds of arguments available to them. This article presents the alternative of relational ethnography. Relational ethnography involves studying fields rather than places, boundaries rather than bounded groups, processes rather than processed people, and cultural conflict rather than group culture. While this approach comes with its own set of challenges, it offers an ethnographic method that works with the relational and processual nature of social reality. Most sociological ethnographies are either of places (e.g., neighborhoods, workplaces) or groups (e.g., single mothers, political activists). This article presents an alternative to group-and place-based fieldwork: relational ethnography. Relational ethnography takes as its scientific object neither a bounded group defined by members' shared social attributes nor a location delimited by the boundaries of a particular neighborhood or the walls of an organization but rather processes involving configurations of relations among different actors or institutions. Since the earliest days of the Chicago School (e.g., Zorbaugh 1929), ethnographers have shown that we cannot hope to understand the dynamics of the social world by comprehending delimited groups as individual cases with semi-autonomous histories and lifestyles. Anthropology, too, has a longstanding interest in studying social rela-tions, going back to the Manchester School (e.g., Mitchell 1956), and has witnessed an efflorescence of relational approaches to fieldwork (Appadurai 1990; Marcus 1998). I am not the first to have discussed nor to have conducted relational ethnography.},

abstract = {Both economists and political scientists have made important contributions to the field of public policy analysis. Economists have stressed the roles of competition, natural monopolies, information asymmetries, externalities, incentives, and federalism in promoting or undermining efficiency. Political scientists, in contrast, have focused more on the mechanics of agenda change, the likelihood of nonincremental policy change, and how the policy-making process varies across issue areas. Economists have influenced government decisions that led to the creation of public utility commissions, emissions trading, revenue sharing, and health maintenance organizations. Political scientists have influenced government decisions on the design of political institutions (environmental impact statements, legislative redistricting) and on the choice of public policies (criminal justice strategies, welfare reform). In general, the presence of a scholarly consensus facilitates the use of policy analysis. However, interest group politics and electoral incentives also play an important role.},

abstract = {Abstract Eco-labeling schemes now exist in nearly every country on Earth and are gaining traction with some of the world's largest companies. However the rigour and credibility of these schemes varies widely. Whereas some eco-labeling organizations (ELOs) adhere to best practices designed to increase the likelihood that their schemes will be rigorous and credible, others do not. In this dissertation, I explain variation in the level of adherence to best practices amongst transnational eco-labeling organizations using a two-phased mixed-method research design. In the first phase, I build and analyze an original dataset comprising information on the policies and practices of 123 transnational ELOs. In the second phase, I build on my statistical findings by further investigating both deductive and abductive hypotheses in the context of two representative case studies, sustainable aquaculture and carbon labeling. My central argument is that who an eco-labeling organization targets for governance holds a strong relationship to its propensity to follow best practices. Specifically, ELOs that “aim big” – meaning those that target a large proportion of a relevant global market – are more likely to follow best practices than those with narrower ambitions. “Aiming big” subjects ELOs to heightened critical scrutiny, increases demand for democratic legitimacy, and over time, augments their organizational capacity. These three conditions, in turn, drive attention to best iii practices and help create rigorous and credible eco-labels with a better chance of meeting environmental objectives. This dissertation contributes in several ways to scholarship on private authority and global governance. First, it suggests that renewed scholarly attention be directed towards the targets of governance, since pressure towards procedural rigour often comes from the governed community and not the owners of a governance scheme. Second, it argues that there is no unitary pathway to rigorous and credible governance; different causal mechanisms and multiple behavioral logics are operative in steering ELOs towards increased best practice adherence. Lastly, it holds implications for policy by suggesting that ELOs should purposively seek global presence and target large businesses when seeking to maximize their environmental impacts.},

@book{Bird2009,
abstract = {This is a book about Natural Language Processing. By “natural language” we mean a
language that is used for everyday communication by humans; languages such as English,
Hindi, or Portuguese. In contrast to artificial languages such as programming languages
and mathematical notations, natural languages have evolved as they pass from
generation to generation, and are hard to pin down with explicit rules. We will take
Natural Language Processing—or NLP for short—in a wide sense to cover any kind of
computer manipulation of natural language. At one extreme, it could be as simple as
counting word frequencies to compare different writing styles. At the other extreme,
NLP involves “understanding” complete human utterances, at least to the extent of
being able to give useful responses to them.
Technologies based on NLP are becoming increasingly widespread. For example,
phones and handheld computers support predictive text and handwriting recognition;
web search engines give access to information locked up in unstructured text; machine
translation allows us to retrieve texts written in Chinese and read them in Spanish. By
providing more natural human-machine interfaces, and more sophisticated access to
stored information, language processing has come to play a central role in the multilingual
information society.
This book provides a highly accessible introduction to the field of NLP. It can be used
for individual study or as the textbook for a course on natural language processing or
computational linguistics, or as a supplement to courses in artificial intelligence, text
mining, or corpus linguistics. The book is intensely practical, containing hundreds of
fully worked examples and graded exercises.
The book is based on the Python programming language together with an open source
library called the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). NLTK includes extensive software,
data, and documentation, all freely downloadable from http://www.nltk.org/.
Distributions are provided for Windows, Macintosh, and Unix platforms. We strongly
encourage you to download Python and NLTK, and try out the examples and exercises

abstract = {Congressional enactments and executive orders instruct agencies to
publish their anticipated rules in what is known as the Unified Agenda. The
Agenda's stated purpose is to ensure that political actors can monitor
regulatory development. Agencies have come under fire in recent years,
however, for conspicuous omissions and irregularities. Critics allege that
agencies hide their regulations from the public strategically, that is, to
thwart potential political opposition. Others contend that such behavior is
benign, perhaps the inevitable result of changing internal priorities or
unforeseen events.
To examine these competing hypotheses, this Article uses a new
dataset spanning over thirty years of rulemaking (1983–2014). Uniquely,
the dataset is drawn directly from the Federal Register. The resulting
findings reveal that agencies substantially underreport their rulemaking
activities—about 70 percent of their proposed rules do not appear on the Unified Agenda before publication. Importantly, agencies also appear to
disclose strategically with respect to Congress, though not with respect to
the president. The Unified Agenda is thus not a successful tool for
Congress to monitor and influence regulatory development. The results
suggest that legislative, not executive, innovations may help to augment
public participation and democratic oversight, though the net effects of
more transparency remain uncertain. The findings also raise further
inquiries, such as why Congress does not render disclosure requirements
judicially enforceable},

abstract = {A great deal of skepticism toward administrative agencies stems from the widespread perception that they
excessively or even exclusively cater to business interests. From the political right comes the accusation that
business interests use regulation to erect barriers to entry that protect profits and stifle competition. From the
political left comes the claim that business interests use secretive interactions with agencies to erode and negate
beneficial regulatory programs. Regulatory “capture” theory elevates many of these claims to the status of
economic law. Despite growing skepticism about capture theory in academic circles, empirical studies of business
influence and capture return ambiguous results, and they have failed to analyze fully the critical agenda-setting
stage of the regulatory process (where business influence is likely to be especially pronounced), leaving capture
theory standing as a plausible description of regulatory policymaking.
In this Article, I take a close look at business influence in the agenda-setting stage of the rulemaking process.
Using original data on all the rulemaking petitions submitted to three administrative agencies from 2000 to
2016, I trace how, when, and why agencies respond, giving attention to the agencies' responsiveness to the type
of petitioner and the character of the requests. Although business interests may participate at a higher rate than
public interest groups and individuals, analysis of the factors that drive agency decision making about which
petitions to accept suggests a distinct lack of any business advantage. Even in a venue where it would be
exceedingly easy to give business interests precisely what they want, agencies remain largely unmoved and evenhanded.
The pattern that does emerge—an agency preference for using petitions to inform incremental revision
of existing regulations to reflect changed circumstances or new technologies—probably does inure mostly to the
benefit of regulated entities, but it is difficult to square with theories of excessive influence or capture of the
regulatory process by business interests. These findings strongly suggest that agencies are able to maintain critical
distance from business in making important decisions about the scope of the regulatory agenda and, by extension,
the content of regulatory law.},

abstract = {Auer deference holds that when agencies interpret their own pre-existing regulations, they receive
deference from reviewing courts. The doctrine serves a critical function in the administrative process, obviating
the need for agencies to undergo costly notice-and-comment rulemaking each time interpretation of existing
regulations is necessary and guaranteeing that agencies' good faith exercise of interpretive discretion will be
respected by courts. But for some leading scholars and jurists, this benign-sounding doctrine actually encourages
agencies to promulgate vague rules in the first instance, augmenting agency power and violating core separationof-powers
norms in the process. This “perverse incentives thesis” has become increasingly influential, but it has
never been tested.
In this article, I scrutinize the perverse incentives thesis from both an empirical and a theoretical
standpoint. I first test the thesis empirically using an original and extensive dataset of federal rules from 1982-
2016. My analysis reveals that agencies did not measurably increase the vagueness of their writing in response
to Auer. If anything, rule writing arguably became more specific over time despite Auer's increasing prominence.
Seeking answers to why there is such a disconnect between theory and reality, I turn inward to the agencies
themselves, contrasting the simple model of comprehensive rationality offered by Auer's critics with a more
realistic institutional account of agency officials as boundedly rational “satisficers.” In particular, I show that
in the choice about whether to offer specificity now or later, agencies are driven by both their inner cognitive
infrastructure and core administrative law (e.g., hard look review) to front-load specificity.
These findings not only caution against taking the fast-moving assault on Auer too far, but also draw
attention to the need to test behavioral theories of administrative law against the empirical record. Because the
administrative state often relaxes formalistic prescriptions that each of the powers of government be hermetically
sealed, it is easy to derive predictions about perverse incentives that result from the combination of powers. But
deriving a model from first principles does not prove a claim, and I argue that core administrative law doctrine
should not be changed on the basis of unsubstantiated theories about its behavioral effects},

the ban on Congressional earmarks has resulted in federal agencies having more control over the

shifted the balance of competing influences over the distributive landscape? Using data on

executive influence and distributive spending. My findings suggest the ban on congressional
earmarks weakens some means of party-centric congressional influence, particularly the
distributive advantage enjoyed by the majority, while leaving those of the president unaffected. I
also find no relationship between an agency's level of independence and distributive outcomes as

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but it has been difficult to determine whether certain
groups are more influential on outcomes. This debate persists because the literature illustrates
that groups can be influential at discrete stages in the process, but the field rarely analyzes the
entire rulemaking process. This uncertainty has spurred controversy regarding the EPA's recent
climate change regulations. Therefore, this dissertation conducted three case studies of recent
climate change regulations and addresses three questions. First, what, if any, strategies did
interest groups use to influence the content of these climate change rules? Second, did these
strategies translate into influence? Third, what can these climate change case studies tell us about
the role of interest groups in other controversial rules at the EPA, and across the bureaucracy
more broadly? Ultimately, I argue that interest group influence was generally balanced across
each of the three case studies. These findings then serve as the basis to develop my Regulatory
Spheres of Influence Framework. The framework illustrates that given the nature of EPA
rulemakings, it is very difficult for one side either business or environmental to dominate the
process in highly controversial rules. It is possible that these conclusions track to other
controversial rules across the bureaucracy and I note that my framework could be applied in
other contexts to test this assertion.},

This article reviews this literature and reanalyzes a set of recent experiments carried out in parallel in both the lab and field. Using a standardized format that calls attention to both the experimental estimates and the statistical uncertainty surrounding them, the study analyzes the overall pattern of lab-field correspondence, which is found to be quite strong (Spearman's r 5 0.73). Recognizing that this correlation may be distorted by the ad hoc manner in which lab-field comparisons are constructed (as well as the selective manner in which results are reported and published), the article concludes by suggesting directions for future research, stressing in particular the need for more systematic investigation of treatment effect heterogeneity. L ab experiments and field experiments offer complementary approaches to the study of cause and effect in the social sciences. Both methods attempt to isolate the causal influence of one or more interventions by eliminating the systematic intrusion of confounding factors. Experiments carried out in lab or field settings typically allocate subjects randomly to treatment and control groups, ensuring that those assigned to each group have the same expected potential outcomes. Apparent differences in outcomes between treatment and control groups therefore reflect either the effect of the treatment or random sampling variability. The interpretation of experimental results, however, depends on the setting in which the study is carried out. Although the line between lab and field is sometimes blurry (Gerber and Green 2012; Harrison and List 2004), lab and field studies typically differ in terms of who the subjects are, the context in which they receive the treatments, the sort of treatments that are administered and the manner in which outcomes are measured. Field experiments tend to assess the effects of a real-world intervention on those who would ordinarily encounter it. Although field experiments frequently use surveys to assess outcomes (cf. Glennerster and Takavarasha 2013), they otherwise tend not to alert subjects to the fact that they are being studied in connection with a particular intervention, and often measure outcomes unobtrusively after the intervention occurs.

Agencies have no incentive to conceal their activities from the overseer; the reforms that are likely to reduce inefficiency are therefore those that improve overseer expertise or lower the costs of agency disclosure, not those that compel disclosure. The normative implications depend on the relative severity of bureaucratic drift and slack problems. When slack is paramount, an overseer that is more anti-regulation than the agency or society improves social welfare, as long as it does not deter the agency from regulating entirely.

framework that, relative to popular models, takes a broader view of the causal structure of regulatory
performance-one that simultaneously allows for presidents, congressional committees, the courts,

factors prove to have significant impacts on NLRB decisions. In addition, the core regulatory actors
-Board members, staff, and constituents-are shown to engage in mutually adaptive adjustment:
each is responsive to the decisions of each of the others, and their reciprocal relationships impart
equilibrating properties to the system as a whole. Thus, the evidence points to a varied set of important
determinants and to the dynamic nature of their interconnection. To the extent that thesefindings

abstract = {No segment of American society should have a monopoly on a clean
environment. Nevertheless, some communities are forced to bear the brunt of
this nation's pollution problem. Industrial toxins, polluted air and drinking
water, and the siting of municipal landfills, lead smelters, incinerators, and
hazardous waste facilities have had a disproportionate impact upon people of
color, working class communities, and the poor.'
Ecological inequities in the United States result from a number of factors,
including the distribution of wealth, housing and real estate practices, and land
use planning.2 Taken together, these factors give rise to what can be called
"environmental racism": practices that place African Americans, Latinos, and
Native Americans at greater health and environmental risk than the rest of
society. This paper analyzes the causes and impacts of environmental
inequities in the United States. Part I examines the links between institutional
racism and ecological disparities. Part II focuses on how institutional racism
affects government practices in the siting of municipal and hazardous waste
disposal facilities. Part I surveys the efforts of people of color to achieve
environmental justice in the United States.},

@article{Monroe2008a,
abstract = {Text is arguably the most pervasive—and certainly the most persistent—artifact of political
behavior. Extensive collections of texts with clearly recognizable political—as
distinct from religious—content go back as far as 2500 BCE in the case of Mesopotamia
and 1300 BCE for China, and 2400-year-old political discussions dating back to the likes
of Plato, Aristotle, and Thucydides are common fare even in the introductory study of
political thought. Political tracts were among the earliest productions following the
introduction of low-cost printing in Europe—fueling more than a few revolutions
and social upheavals—and continuous printed records of legislative debates, such as
the British parliament's Hansard and precursors tracing to 1802, cover centuries of
political discussion.
The possibility that the analysis of texts could provide insights into the political processes
also has a long pedigree. The Italian humanist Lorenzo Valla's careful philological
analysis of the reputed Donation of Constantine in 1439 convincingly demonstrated, using
purely textual methods, that the document was a medieval forgery that must have postdated
the Emperor Constantine I by at least four centuries. Moving toward our own day, the first
modern, theoretically driven content analysis project was Harold Lasswell's Wartime
Communications Project just prior to the outbreak of World War II (Janowitz 1968),
and subsequently, content analysis became a standard analytical tool in the West, particularly
for the analysis of ‘‘enemy'' communications, first Nazi and later Communist.
Given the tedious nature of human coding, researchers recognized early on that systematic
textual analysis might be suited to automation. Harvard's General Inquirer(Stone et al.
1966) emerged as the first widely used computer program for automated content analysis,
and re-written from the original IBM language PL/1 into Java, it persists to this day.1 However,
most of the development of automated tools within the context of the social sciences
occurred in Europe (see Alexa and Zuell 1999; Popping 2000), though automated natural
language processing in general continued apace in computer science (e.g., Salton 1989;
Smith 1990), and occasionally, these efforts would move into the political realm (e.g.,
ARPA 1993).},

We develop theoretical expectations about the representational effects of direct election by a relatively inexpert mass electorate and indirect election by a relatively expert political intermediary, based on principal-agent theory. The chief predictions are that the representative will bemore responsive to the mass electorate under direct election, but will also have more discretion to pursue his or her own ends. We use the 17th Amendment as a quasi-experiment to test the predictions of the theory. Statistical models show strong support for both predictions.Moreover, the 17th Amendment is not associated with similar changes in the U.S. House of Representatives—as expected, since the amendment did not change House electoral institutions.},

Yet no one feels compelled even to try to tell you where the modern world came from, what causes it to hang around, and, by extension, what might cause it to go.

We need a small set of key elements that repeatedly give structure to this politics. We need an extended period in which these key elements can interact, ideally in differing ways. And we need a process of policy-making that emerges from this interaction, a diagnostic process that can be compared—that itself evolves—across time. At any given point, these elements together contribute the ‘big picture' in American politics. Across time, they tell a story of political stability and, especially, political change.

To explore this question , I consider a simple policymaking environment in which an expert agency develops policy that is upheld or overturned by an overseer who may have different policy goals. The agency can affect the quality of implementation through effort investments in addition to choosing the substantive content of policy. Under procedural review the overseer only reviews the agencys effort, which allows the agency to fully utilize its expertise, but may harm effort incentives. Substantive review also tasks the overseer with judging agencies substantive policy choices, which introduces a fundamental trade-off between agency utilization of expertise and effort investment due to pathological policy choices made by the agency. The theory characterizes when less transparent oversight, procedural review, is optimal relative to more transparent, substantive review. The results speak to when agencies should be insulated from substantive review.},
annote = {From Duplicate 1 (Reviewing Procedure vs. Judging Substance: The Scope of Review and Bureaucratic Policymaking * - Turner, Ian R)

thinking about when bureaucrats have incentives
to exaggerate or minimize problems in order to get their desired policy. I have a number of related questions, mostly on the assumptions, and a few
half-baked thoughts about alternative ways to describe the parameterization.
1. Why is effort chosen before the policy position? In the introduction, you
discuss investment in effort as implementation capacity, but in the model, it
looks to me more like search costs related to developing expertise in the policy
area. I am having a hard time thinking about a situation where investments are
made in implementation capacity before a rule is made, but there are definitely
costs to making a good rule (i.e. one that can be successfully implemented).
There are also incentives to make rules that can be implemented with existing
capacity, so maybe an alternative way to think about e is the choice to make
a rule that can be implemented given an agency's capacity. Choosing to bear
the search costs of identifying a successful implementation strategy, e = 1, is
costly for the agency and, as per your model, they will not bear these costs if
they are going to get reversed. If they know they are going to get reversed, they
will go into rulemaking with a bad rule (or not go at all, but that is a separate
issue). This seems consistent with e being the subject of procedural review–
which is often more about whether the agency used expertise than whether it
has sufficient implementation capacity. Another, related, way to think about
it is that e is the search cost for the agency to discover {\$}\omega{\$} with a greater level
of precision. I think this is the cleanest way to think about e. Here, instead
of observing investment in capacity or in identifying policy mechanisms, the
agency may be conducting hearings, commissioning reports, and RFIs to learn
about {\$}\omega{\$}. This also seems consistent with procedural review based on expertise
and good process. Either way, thinking about e as search costs gets you out
of the question about who really sets the budget for implementation capacity.
This leads to my next question:
2. To what extent is investment in capacity for successful implementation a
choice that agencies really face? The model assumes that agency investments
are based on their incentives. Are bureaucrats naturally lazy and principals
demanding procedural goals like equal protection etc. can incentivize them to
“work harder,” or are bureaucrats more often the ones pushing for successful
implementation and procedural fairness (indeed, their careers are often longer
than their principals' and they are closer to the harms that may come to people)
but their elected principals either (1) don't give them enough resources or (2)
don't actually want equal protection. I see the withholding of investments and
policy with racial or class biases emerging more from elected officials than from
bureaucrats or courts.
For example, did FEMA not invest in better computers because they did
not want to or because Congress did not give them enough money? In the story
in your presentation, it seemed like FEMA used the computer failure to argue
for more money, and then they got it. Perhaps FEMA should have submitted a
Turner, Reviewing Procedure vs. Judging Substance Judge-Lord Notes
budget request for a new computer system earlier, but it seems they would have
likely been overturned by either the White House the appropriations committee
until FEMA could claim that a crisis demanded more money.1
3. Do agencies care more about policies in which they have sunk costs?
Assuming that investment in costs like computer systems are chosen by the
agency and that they are chosen before the policy position, the model predicts
that they are more likely to lie about the state of the world when they have
a high e. Why is e part of their utility function at the point where they are
deciding whether to lie or not? Once they know the state of the world, should
not the agency always tell the principal whatever is likely to avoid reversal,
regardless of whether they have sunk costs? Perhaps this result comes from the
fact that e is in the principal's utility function, leading to my next question:
4. Do overseers care about sunk costs in a program with which they disagree?
The paper concludes that higher effort investments lead to more deference because
it lowers the error. Why do they want high-quality implementation /
cerianty of a policy they dislike?
5. The setup has principals always preferring less action to more. This is
not the case and it seems possible to capture the reverse in this model, i.e.
when {\$}\beta{\$} or {\$}\omega{\$} is negative the principal prefers more policy action, right? If a
model with negative {\$}\omega{\$} or {\$}\beta{\$} gets us the same mathematical results, this would
mean that when {\$}\omega{\$} or {\$}\beta{\$} is negative, then the substantive result is the opposite
of “crying wolf”–I am not sure what to call this, minimizing? But in this world,
does the principal still have the same incentives not to overturn? If an agency
is minimizing a problem, then they care less about overturning than they ought
to and might be more likely to do it when {\$}\beta{\$} is high. I am not sure if I am
thinking about this correctly, but it seems interesting.
6. Ealy in the paper, {\$}\beta{\$} is called “bias,” but later you call it “preferences
divergence”–I prefer thinking about it the latter way. I would find it more clear
if we could say that {\$}\omega{\$} is the agency's ideal point and {\$}\omega{\$} − {\$}\beta{\$} is the principal's
ideal point, assuming a high cost to reversing for high values of {\$}\omega{\$}, right? This
seems to allow us to take seriously the idea that the agency does have an ideal
point, {\$}\omega{\$}, it is just uncertain about what policy x best satisfies it until the state
of the world is revealed (or until it bears [search] costs e). I find it more intuitive
to speak about agency and principal preferences rather than states of the world.
You offer the insight that when potential costs of inaction are high, principals
are more willing to tolerate more divergent agency policies. Currently, the
model assumes that those costs are co-determined with what the agency wants
(i.e. both a wrapped up in {\$}\omega{\$}). I am fine with that. Principals may very well
interpret extreme agency preferences as a signal that the costs of inaction are
high, especially if agencies are fairly sincere in their pursuit of the public good
and have expertise in their subject area.
Best,
Devin
1This reminds me that budgets are another form of proposal, subject to rejection by principals,
but I am not sure budget proposals fit in your model. If they do, let me know because I
have collected a bunch of data on agency budget proposals and corresponding appropriations.

which is often more about whether the agency used expertise than whether it
has sufficient implementation capacity. Another, related, way to think about
it is that e is the search cost for the agency to discover $\omega$ with a greater level
of precision. I think this is the cleanest way to think about e. Here, instead
of observing investment in capacity or in identifying policy mechanisms, the
agency may be conducting hearings, commissioning reports, and RFIs to learn
about $\omega$. This also seems consistent with procedural review based on expertise
and good process. Either way, thinking about e as search costs gets you out
of the question about who really sets the budget for implementation capacity.
This leads to my next question:
2. To what extent is investment in capacity for successful implementation a
choice that agencies really face? The model assumes that agency investments
are based on their incentives. Are bureaucrats naturally lazy and principals
demanding procedural goals like equal protection etc. can incentivize them to
“work harder,” or are bureaucrats more often the ones pushing for successful
implementation and procedural fairness (indeed, their careers are often longer
than their principals' and they are closer to the harms that may come to people)
but their elected principals either (1) don't give them enough resources or (2)
don't actually want equal protection. I see the withholding of investments and
policy with racial or class biases emerging more from elected officials than from
bureaucrats or courts.
For example, did FEMA not invest in better computers because they did
not want to or because Congress did not give them enough money? In the story
in your presentation, it seemed like FEMA used the computer failure to argue
for more money, and then they got it. Perhaps FEMA should have submitted a
Turner, Reviewing Procedure vs. Judging Substance Judge-Lord Notes
budget request for a new computer system earlier, but it seems they would have
likely been overturned by either the White House the appropriations committee
until FEMA could claim that a crisis demanded more money.1
3. Do agencies care more about policies in which they have sunk costs?
Assuming that investment in costs like computer systems are chosen by the
agency and that they are chosen before the policy position, the model predicts
that they are more likely to lie about the state of the world when they have
a high e. Why is e part of their utility function at the point where they are
deciding whether to lie or not? Once they know the state of the world, should
not the agency always tell the principal whatever is likely to avoid reversal,
regardless of whether they have sunk costs? Perhaps this result comes from the
fact that e is in the principal's utility function, leading to my next question:
4. Do overseers care about sunk costs in a program with which they disagree?
The paper concludes that higher effort investments lead to more deference because
it lowers the error. Why do they want high-quality implementation /
cerianty of a policy they dislike?
5. The setup has principals always preferring less action to more. This is
not the case and it seems possible to capture the reverse in this model, i.e.
when $\beta$ or $\omega$ is negative the principal prefers more policy action, right? If a
model with negative $\omega$ or $\beta$ gets us the same mathematical results, this would
mean that when $\omega$ or $\beta$ is negative, then the substantive result is the opposite
of “crying wolf”–I am not sure what to call this, minimizing? But in this world,
does the principal still have the same incentives not to overturn? If an agency
is minimizing a problem, then they care less about overturning than they ought
to and might be more likely to do it when $\beta$ is high. I am not sure if I am
thinking about this correctly, but it seems interesting.
6. Ealy in the paper, $\beta$ is called “bias,” but later you call it “preferences
divergence”–I prefer thinking about it the latter way. I would find it more clear
if we could say that $\omega$ is the agency's ideal point and $\omega$ − $\beta$ is the principal's
ideal point, assuming a high cost to reversing for high values of $\omega$, right? This
seems to allow us to take seriously the idea that the agency does have an ideal
point, $\omega$, it is just uncertain about what policy x best satisfies it until the state
of the world is revealed (or until it bears [search] costs e). I find it more intuitive
to speak about agency and principal preferences rather than states of the world.
You offer the insight that when potential costs of inaction are high, principals
are more willing to tolerate more divergent agency policies. Currently, the
model assumes that those costs are co-determined with what the agency wants
(i.e. both a wrapped up in $\omega$). I am fine with that. Principals may very well
interpret extreme agency preferences as a signal that the costs of inaction are
high, especially if agencies are fairly sincere in their pursuit of the public good
and have expertise in their subject area.
Best,
Devin
1This reminds me that budgets are another form of proposal, subject to rejection by principals,
but I am not sure budget proposals fit in your model. If they do, let me know because I
have collected a bunch of data on agency budget proposals and corresponding appropriations.},

abstract = {Economics does not now provide a theory of the maximizing bureaucrat.
The currently dominant approach to public administration is to
provide the organizational structure, information system, and analysis
to bureaucrats who, for whatever reason, want to be efficient. This
approach, however, does not develop, or explicitly recognize as relevant,
the conditions for which the personal objectives of the bureaucrat are
consistent with the efficiency of the bureaucracy.
At present, with a large and increasing proportion of economic activity
being conducted in bureaus, economists have made no substantial
contribution to answering the following questions: What are the distinguishing
characteristics of bureaucracies? What are the critical
elements of a theory of bureaucracy? Specifically, what do bureaucrats
maximize and under what external conditions? What are the consequences
of maximizing behavior under these conditions? For example,
what is the equilibrium output and budget of a bureau for given demand
and cost conditions? What are the effects of changes in demand and
cost conditions? What are the welfare consequences of bureaucratic
organization of economic activity? What changes in organization and
the structure of rewards would improve the efficiency of a bureaucracy?
This paper presents a simple model of the maximizing bureaucrat and,
based on this model, a set of tentative qualitative answers to these
questions.
II. The Model
The model outlined in this section is based on the following two
critical characteristics of bureaus: (1) Bureaucrats maximize the total
budget of their bureau, given demand and cost conditions, subject to
the constraint that the budget must be equal to or greater than the minimum
total costs at the equilibrium output. (2) Bureaus exchange a
specific output (or combination of outputs) for a specific budget. For
this paper, thus, bureaus are defined by these two characteristics.
Among the several variables that may enter the bureaucrat's utility
function are the following: salary, perquisites of the office, public reputation,
power, patronage, ease of managing the bureau, and },

abstract = {The Politics of Precedent on the U.S. Supreme Courtoffers an insightful and provocative analysis of the Supreme Court's most important task--shaping the law. Thomas Hansford and James Spriggs analyze a key aspect of legal change: the Court's interpretation or treatment of the precedents it has set in the past. Court decisions do not just resolve immediate disputes; they also set broader precedent. The meaning and scope of a precedent, however, can change significantly as the Court revisits it in future cases. The authors contend that these interpretations are driven by an interaction between policy goals and variations in the legal authoritativeness of precedent. From this premise, they build an explanation of the legal interpretation of precedent that yields novel predictions about the nature and timing of legal change. Hansford and Spriggs test their hypotheses by examining how the Court has interpreted the precedents it set between 1946 and 1999. This analysis provides compelling support for their argument, and demonstrates that the justices' ideological goals and the role of precedent are inextricably linked. The two prevailing, yet contradictory, views of precedent--that it acts either solely as a constraint, or as a "cloak" that never actually influences the Court--are incorrect. This book shows that while precedent can operate as a constraint on the justices' decisions, it also represents an opportunity to foster preferred societal outcomes.},

abstract = {This article addresses three questions about notice and comment rule rrmaking. The first considers who participates: Who submits comments to federal agencies during the notice and comment period? The second considers the extent to which the comments alter the content of the rules. The third is about evaluating agency rule making in the context of the iron triangle and issue network models of policy making. The article examines eleven rules selected randomly at the EPA, NHTSA, and HUD. Among the findings are. a dearth of citizen commenters, the predominance of participation by business interests, and the presence of issue networks, and the absence of any discernible bias in whose voices get heard. The article concludes by suggesting that agencies fail to hear from all affected parties but that they are nonetheless put in the precarious position of arbitrating among competing interests. In the textbook version of American politics, Congress is responsible for law making. This has led scholars to study the legislative process and to pay particular attention to the role of interest groups in that process. However, particularly since the 1960s, Congress has delegated significant portions of its law-making responsibilities to federal administrative agencies. The administrative analogue to law making is known as rule making-the process by which federal agencies issue regulations. We are all familiar with these regulations-EPA regulations dictate the standards that our cars must meet with respect to auto emissions, FDA regulations govern the labels that appear on the products we buy at the supermarket, SEC regulations determine the information provided to shareholders-and they are a major determinant of public policy. However, there is an important distinction between congressional law making and agency rule making. Although},

We do not, however, rely exclusively on the predominant statistical models— variants of standard regression analysis—to address them. Because these tools alone are ill-suited to the task at hand, we deploy a more appropriate methodology—non-parametric matching—which follows from a formal framework for causal inference. Applying matching methods to sex discrimination suits resolved in the federal circuits between 1995 and 2002 yields two clear results. First, we observe substantial individual effects: The like- lihood of a judge deciding in favor of the party alleging discrimination decreases by about 10 percentage points when the judge is a male. Likewise, we find that men are significantly more likely to rule in favor of the rights litigant when a woman serves on the panel. Both effects are so persistent and consistent that they may come as a surprise even to those scholars who have long posited the existence of gendered judging.},

Hall develops an original theory to account for varying levels of participation across members and issues, within House and Senate, and across pre- and postreform periods of the modern Congress. By closely analyzing behavior on sixty bills in the areas of agriculture, human resources, and commerce, Hall finds that participation at each stage of the legislative process is rarely universal and never equal. On any given issue, most members who are eligible to participate forego the opportunity to do so, leaving a self-selected few to deliberate on the policy. These active members often do not reflect the values and interests evident in their parent chamber.

This book provides the first full account of the role of national intra-party "factions" in American politics. A faction, as defined here, is a party sub-unit that has enough ideological consistency, organizational capacity, and temporal durability to sustain intra-party conflict. Factions are loosely organized networks made up of members of Congress, party activists, pressure groups, policy entrepreneurs, and intellectuals. They are engines of political change that develop new ideas, refine them into workable policies, and promote them in government. Because America's big-tent parties are cumbersome instruments, factions help account for changes in public policy, modes of electoral mobilization, and the parties' ideological positions. This study explains how factions' shape the parties' ideologies, impact presidential nominations, distribute power in Congress, structure patterns of presidential governance, and impact the development of the American state. It shows how factions are often as or more important than the parties in driving political change.

abstract = {In pursuing their goals, members of the U.S. Supreme Court are affected by their institutional setting. How has that institutional environment changed over time and what have been the political consequences of those changes? Despite considerable analysis of the institutional dynamics of legislatures and executives, political scientists have been slow to bring time series techniques to the study of the Supreme Court, and as a result much less is known about its evolutionary path. Measuring a variety of organizational characteristics, I construct an index of the institutionalization of the Supreme Court from 1790 to 1996. This indicator suggests that the integration of the Court into the system of federal policy making has better enabled the justices to satisfy their objectives. To demonstrate this empirically, I test a series of error correction models of judicial influence, each of which confirms that the nature of the Supreme Court's character has had considerable implications for the scope of the justices' legal and political impact. These results underscore the need for judicial scholars to examine the Court's policy making in longitudinal perspective.},

Usually, American politics is looked on as relatively consensual and nonideological, but John Gerring argues that American party history and, by extension, American political history at large have been irreducibly ideological. He contends that the major parties have articulated views that were, and are, coherent, differentiated, and stable. The argument rests on evidence provided by election rhetoric - speeches, party platforms, and other campaign tracts disseminated by party leaders during presidential campaigns. Using these texts, Professor Gerring traces the values, beliefs, and issue-positions that have defined party life from the 1830s to the 1990s.

Past research on legislative voting and elections suggests that voters punish members who are ideologically “out of step” with their districts. In seeking to move beyond the emphasis in the literature on the effects of ideological extremity on legislative vote share, we examine how partisan loyalty can adversely affect legislators' electoral fortunes. Specifically, we estimate the effects of each legislator's party unity—the tendency of a member to vote with his or her party on salient issues that divide the two major parties—on vote margin when running for reelection. Our results suggest that party loyalty on divisive votes can indeed be a liability for incumbent House members. In fact, we find that voters are not punishing elected representatives for being too ideological; they are punishing them for being too partisan.},

Gridlock is in fact the order of the day, occurring even when the same party controls the legislative and executive branches. Meticulously researched and anchored to real politics, Krehbiel argues that the pivotal vote on a piece of legislation is not the one that gives a bill a simple majority, but the vote that allows its supporters to override a possible presidential veto or to put a halt to a filibuster. This theory of pivots also explains why, when bills are passed, winning coalitions usually are bipartisan and supermajority sized. Offering an incisive account of when gridlock is overcome and showing that political parties are less important in legislative-executive politics than previously thought, Pivotal Politics remakes our understanding of American lawmaking.},

However, conflicting theoretical and empirical findings have given rise to a significant discrepancy in the scholarship. Building on evidence from interviews with Supreme Court justices and former law clerks, I develop a formal model of judicial-congressional relations that incorporates judicial preferences for institutional legitimacy and the role of public opinion in congressional hostility towards the Supreme Court. An original dataset identifying all Court-curbing legislation proposed between 1877 and 2006 is then used to assess the influence of congressional hostility on the Court's use of judicial review. The evidence indicates that public discontent with the Court, as mediated through congressional hostility, creates an incentive for the Court to exercise self-restraint. When Congress is hostile, the Court uses judicial review to invalidate Acts of Congress less frequently than when Congress is not hostile towards the Court.},

These procedures can provide useful information to policy makers about the preferences of those who stand to be affected by agency actions. More importantly, they serve as cues for the accommodation of interests and the resolution of conflict through processes that are grounded in agencies' accountability to political officials. Yet, an examination of the interrelationship between formal, procedural constraints and the informal processes surrounding them reveals that the effects of notice and comment in promoting bureaucratic responsiveness are limited in ways that have received little systematic analysis. A consideration of the tension between the instrumental goal of procedural accountability and the political tasks that often dominate bureaucratic policy making suggests that it is desirable to return to the original use of notice and comment as a device for exposing agencies to the views of affected interests.},

The authors present an institutional explanation for this observation based on recent work on veto players and delegated discretion to administrative agents. They argue that the presence of partisan veto players discourages focus on rulemaking in APAs.},

abstract = {What effect does regulatory auditing by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
(OIRA) have on the production of regulations in the agencies? In particular, does targeting an
agency for heavy regulatory auditing inhibit its production of regulations, a “chilling” effect?
Does heavy auditing encourage it to substitute multiple small regulations in place of single large
one, “OIRA avoidance”? We present an early empirical analysis of these questions by estimating
regulation production functions for federal agencies, using data from the Unified Agenda
from 1995 to 2010. We attempt to distinguish the differential effects of regulatory auditing
from appointments into the agencies, leveraging off exogenous variation created by independent
regulatory commissions. Our data uncover no evidence of a chilling effect in the production of
economically significant regulations due to the Bush administration's regulatory auditing,
relative to the Clinton or early Obama administrations. Nor do we find any evidence of OIRA
avoidance. We do find some evidence that the Bush administration reduced the production of
noneconomically significant regulations overall. However, the effect appears to be due to appointments
in the agencies. Overall, the results raise questions about the efficacy of presidential efforts
to control the regulatory state and how best to evaluate those efforts.},

@article{McCarty2000,
abstract = {It is often argued that executive powers such as the veto serve to reduce particularistic spending by the legislature. I argue that the effect of the executive veto depends strongly on assumptions about both the nature of executive preferences and the institutional structure of executive-legislative bargaining. To support these claims, I develop a model of distributive policymaking subject to an executive veto. This framework incorporates variation in presidential objectives and formal powers into a dynamic bargaining model. In equilibrium, stronger veto power leads to a lower level of distributive spending, but the effects are mitigated to the extent that the president prefers spending in some districts over others. The model also generates new insights and predictions about fiscal policy under the separation of powers, including the effects of divided government, electoral rules, and term limitations for the executive.},

abstract = {Both pundits and scholars have blamed increasing levels of partisan conflict and polarization in Congress on the effects of partisan gerrymandering. We assess whether there is a strong causal relationship between congressional districting and polarization. We find very little evidence for such a link. First, we show that congressional polarization is primarily a function of the differences in how Democrats and Republicans represent the same districts rather than a function of which districts each party represents or the distribution of constituency preferences. Second, we conduct simulations to gauge the level of polarization under various "neutral" districting procedures. We find that the actual levels of polarization are not much higher than those produced by the simulations. We do find that gerrymandering has increased the Republican seat share in the House; however, this increase is not an important source of polarization.},

abstract = {Mayhew is interested in examining how we should study legislative behavior, what assumptions we should make, and what conclusions we should draw from these assumptions. He argues that first and foremost, reelection is the proximate goal of every member, and it must be achieved before other goals can be considered. He clearly notes that the goal isn't necessarly vote maximization because to win all the votes might be neccesarily costly and MC's operate in a world of uncertainty. Mayhew identified three types of activities that Congressman engage in: advertising, credit claiming (especially in relation to particularized benefits), and position taking. He concludes by noting that committee structure and output as well as parties are both geared towards this reelection incentive as well. Because members are single-minded seekers of reelection, we can start to study them as such.},
annote = {Congress: The Electoral Connection (1974),17 Mayhew executed one of the first—and still one of the best—rational choice studies of Congress, par- simoniously asking how members would logically behave if they were obsessed only with the goal of assuring their reelection. He deduces that in such circum- stances, members would do a lot of what we observe them doing: position-taking, credit-claiming, and advertising. The assumption of pure reelection-mindedness yields less-good predictions 
o   Three themes have emerged as particularly sig- nificant in the ensuing decades. First, scholars have devoted considerable energy to understanding the major reforms adopted by Congress in the 1970s. Both the reform era itself and the contours of the so-called “post-reform” Congress have been major topics of debate. Second, the rise of rational choice approaches in the discipline at large has sparked a new focus on the design and effects of legis- lative institutions. Scholars ask to what extent congressional organization serves the interests of three sorts of aggregated actors: cross-party distributive coalitions, the majority party, and floor majorities. A major animating issue has been whether the majority party is able to use its agenda control to pull policy outcomes toward the party median and away from the median of the whole House. Third, histori- cally oriented scholars have traced changes in congressional institutions over time,

He lays out his pivotal politics theory to account for that and shows that legislative productivity is negatively related to the size of the gridlock interval.},
address = {Chicago, IL},
annote = {{\textperiodcentered}      Krehbiel 
o   Assumptions 
{\S}  You can plot congressmen on a line 
{\S}  There is an exogenous status quo 
{\S}  The actors are pres and members (one camberial) 
{\S}  They have a single peaked preference on that dimension 
o   Procedures: Veto/cloture 
o   Full convergance: policy shifts to median 
o   Parital convergance: policy shifits toward the median, but only so far as veto or fillabuster pivot 
o   Gridlock 
Politicians and pundits alike have complained that the divided governments of the last decades have led to legislative gridlock. Not so, argues Keith Krehbiel, who advances the provocative theory that divided government actually has little effect on legislative productivity. Gridlock is in fact the order of the day, occurring even when the same party controls the legislative and executive branches. Meticulously researched and anchored to real politics, Krehbiel argues that the pivotal vote on a piece of legislation is not the one that gives a bill a simple majority, but the vote that allows its supporters to override a possible presidential veto or to put a halt to a filibuster. This theory of pivots also explains why, when bills are passed, winning coalitions usually are bipartisan and supermajority sized. Offering an incisive account of when gridlock is overcome and showing that political parties are less important in legislative-executive politics than previously thought, Pivotal Politics remakes our understanding of American lawmaking.Krishna and Morgan propose "amendments" to two of Gilligan and Krehbiel's theoretical studies of legislative signaling. The new results for homogeneous committees do not significantly change the empirical expectations of prior works, but the results for heterogeneous committees contradict earlier claims. This note gives primary attention to heterogeneous committees and compares and contrasts the new and old equilibria and their empirical implications. The notion of signaling is somewhat nebulous in all such games but seems distinctly less plausible in the key Krishna-Morgan proposition than in previous legislative signaling games. Furthermore, the empirical literature on choice of rules-specifically, the finding of a positive relationship between committee heterogeneity and restrictive rules-is inconsistent with the Krishna-Morgan analysis but consistent with Gilligan-Krehbiel analyses, even though the former is informationally efficient and the latter are not.

abstract = {This volume demonstrates how party insiders from America's founding to the present day have sought to control presidential nominations as a meanns of getting what they want from government. Contrary to the common view that the reforms of the 1970s wrested power away from parties, the authors contend that the most consequential contests remain candidates' fights for prominent endorsements and the support of various interest groups, activists, and party leaders. These invisible primaries, the authors show, produce front-runners and profoundly influence final election outcomes long before most voters even begin to pay attention. -- from back cover. The outrageous nomination of Hubert Humphrey -- Whose parties? -- The creation of new parties -- Weak structures, strong parties -- Last hurrahs of the old system.

@article{Epstein2000,
abstract = {As papers presented at recent disciplinary conferences and articles published in major political science journals reveal, the field of judicial politics is undergoing a sea change. Variants of the social-psychological paradigm, which have long dominated thinking about law and courts, are giving way to approaches grounded in assumptions in rationality. More to the point, ever-growing numbers of scholars are now invoking the strategic account to understand judicial politics. In what follows, we investigate this "strategic revolution." We begin by providing an intellectual history of the field, with special emphasis on why judicial specialists resisted strategic analysis for so long and why they are now (re)turning to it in ever-increasing numbers. Next, we consider the ways that analysts have begun to put the strategic account to work. This is an important task, for debates are already emerging over the "best" way to invoke the account to study judicial politics. We take the position that there is no one "right" way but rather four different approaches - all of which have the potential to provide us with important insights into law and courts.},

abstract = {An established line of research demonstrates that vague judicial opinions are less likely to be implemented than clear opinions. Vague opinions thus present a puzzle. Why would judges craft opinions that risk noncompliance?We argue that the relationships between judges and other policy makers in separation-of-powers systems are central to understanding this puzzle. Opinion vagueness can reflect efforts to resolve core tradeoffs associated with judicial policymaking that bear some resemblance to standard accounts of political delegation. Vagueness offers judges the ability to manage their uncertainty over policy outcomes and to hide likely defiance from public view. At the same time, vagueness removes a central source of pressure for compliance that judges can place on other policy makers. Using a game-theoretic model, we identify conditions under which judges use vagueness precisely as legislatures use statutory discretion.We also demonstrate conditions under which judges use vagueness in ways unanticipated by standard delegation accounts.},

@book{Bartels2016,
abstract = {The first edition of Unequal Democracy was an instant classic, shattering illusions about American democracy and spurring scholarly and popular interest in the political causes and consequences of escalating economic inequality.

This revised and expanded edition includes two new chapters on the political economy of the Obama era. One presents the Great Recession as a "stress test" of the American political system by analyzing the 2008 election and the impact of Barack Obama's “New New Deal” on the economic fortunes of the rich, middle class, and poor. The other assesses the politics of inequality in the wake of the Occupy Wall Street movement, the 2012 election, and the partisan gridlock of Obama's second term. Larry Bartels offers a sobering account of the barriers to change posed by partisan ideologies and the political power of the wealthy. He also provides new analyses of tax policy, partisan differences in economic performance, the struggle to raise the minimum wage, and inequalities in congressional representation.

President Obama identified inequality as “the defining challenge of our time.” Unequal Democracy is the definitive account of how and why our political system has failed to rise to that challenge. Now more than ever, this is a book every American needs to read.

abstract = {Among political scientists, not only is it uncontroversial to say that judges seek to etch their political values into law; it would be near heresy to suggest otherwise. And yet this article does just that because research conducted by scholars (mostly outside of political science) has demonstrated that the policy goal is not the only motivation; it may not even be dominant for many judges. The evidence is now so strong that it poses a serious challenge to the extremely (un)realist(ic) conception of judicial behavior that has dominated the study of law and legal institutions for generations. In addition to reviewing this evidence, we offer a more realistic conception of judicial motivations and suggest how different approaches to the study of courts can contribute to this new avenue of research.},

Their argument that judges are rational actors if frequency assumed. Each section takes the general form: 
“a [rational] justice would have no reason not to [act rationally]” where the act is something judges are well known to do frequently. “How common is this? It is common.” Thus, the data show that judges are rational actors.

Rational choices are understood to be sophisticated and frequently change. Quotes from internal memos suggest these changes are made in light of information about the preferences of others. Do these memos lack reasonings and arguments? The authors never entertain the notion that justices may be convinced.

In addition to new preferences, new choices are often introduced/invented. In this context, how are we to understand rational action related to stable preferences on issues that are entirely new. Can a justice have fixed preferences relative to an issues one has never thought about. For example, in the case used to introduce the argument, the NAACP amicus brief suggested a new potential standard of review. Epstein and Knight first use the positions announced by justices at the cert hearing as evidence of original positions / sincere preferences. They take the change from these ‘original.sincere' preferences to the NAACP standard as strategic accommodation to form a majority. However, they later note how these statements are ambiguous and may be strategic. All of this is taken to be evidence that judges are strategic actors. Unfortunately, Epstein and Knight fail to escape from the tautology of preferences and actions.

They use the same example to illustrate why a justice may select an outcome other than her most preferred when her most preferred is in the minority. Justices may settle on some middle ground or set the issue aside by ruling on a different issue. However, in order for the example to illustrate their point, at least one justice must be assumed to prioritize jurisprudence over policy. If judges can rationally prefer jurisprudence as their top preference, and it is not merely a restrain imposed by the need to maintain legitimacy (as they suggest), then what does it mean to say judges are rational?

They discuss at length the strategic reasons for one justice to make suggestions others, including to author of the opinion when one is deserting (pg93), but the rational for the opinion writer to grant the request is simply “giving Brennan a small victory in a case otherwise decided against his interests.” Why?

The authors concede significant ground on the use of a rational choice framework. Judges lack key information and sometimes prefer legal principles to material policy victories, choice spaces change in the course of deliberation and innovative reasoning, and decision-making context is “shaped by rules, norms, and conventions,” which are uncertain and also change over time.

abstract = {When a vacancy occurs on the Supreme Court, the president can attempt to use his power of nomination strategically in order to bring thte Court in line with his own policy preferences. However, the president faces two constraints when attempting to do so. First, he may be constrained by the presence of continuing justices and the existing Court median. Second, he may be constrained by the Senate, which must approve his nominee. In this paper, we develop and test a theory that examines that conditions under which a president is constrained in his choice of a nominee. Our results show that presidents can, and do, behave strategically with respect to Supreme Court nominations.},

abstract = {The focus of this analysis is whether a strategic perspective provides a useful approach that enhances an understanding of broad patterns of judicial decision making on the U.S. Courts of Appeals. The authors examine whether it is reasonable in the majority of cases for appeals court judges to modify their behavior when necessary to avoid reversal by the Supreme Court. This assessment utilizes statistical analyses and interviews from twenty-eight judges on the U.S. Courts of Appeals. Based on a three-part argument, the authors conclude that a strategic perspective is not helpful in understanding the decision calculus of appeals court judges. {\textcopyright} 2009 University of Utah.},

Is this fair? Schlesinger criticized Neustadt for arguing that in a nuclear age, the president had to act without Congress or the Courts in the event of a crisis, that “debate within the executive branch could replace Congress as a means of check and balance in the nuclear age (Imperial Presidency, p. 189). Is there really a link between Neustadt and irresponsible use of power? Is it fair, as Normon Thomas wrote in 1981, that “Neustadt has been likened to a modern Machiavelli”? 

3. Given the uncertainties of executive power (a central element of Corwin), is it realistic to expect anything other than aggressive use of presidential power to fill in the gaps (indeed, this is a major premise of the contemporary unilateral powers literature)?},

{\S}Committees align influence and interest “property rights to that policy area” – perato improvement from all having equal influence over all areas 
{\S}Fiorina 1987 (pg 338) “the committee systems as the e formal expression of a comprehensive logrolling arrangement. In a large, diverse republic political interests will be heterogeneous-things dear to one set of representa- tives will be of little value to others, and vice versa. Thus, logrolling can produce gains from trade ... But if opportunities to make the same sorts of trades are expected to occur repeatedly, transactions costs can be cut by institutionalizing the trades. Thus leg- islatures establish committees with specialized jurisdictions, permit their members to self-select positions on committees with greatest interest..., and adopt "norms" that lubricate the gears of the system.... In full bloom this system allows members to exer- cise disproportionate influence on the formulation and implementation of policies important for their electoral interest and provides a variety of opportunities to claim political credit.... There is one potential glitch in the system, however. Theoretically, logrolled outcomes are not in equilibrium.... Someone always has a short-term incen- tive to attempt to unravel them on the floor. Thus, some means of enforcing agreements must be present. 
{\S}To work, institution requires 
{\'{u}} 1mechanism allowing inds to flow to committees 
{\'{u}} 2 committee retains influence 
{\'{u}} 3 system of jurisdictions must accommodate the rise of new issues

{\S}ignored transaction costs 
o Thrid gen (informational theories) recognized this and focused on transaction cost and collective action problems 
{\S}stimulates development of institutions that smooth transaction costs (Weigast and Marshall 1988) 
o distributive theories paint an individualistic, conflictive, and demand-side picture of legislative politics. Informational theories extend beyond these three features. They explicitly characterize collective objectives alongside individually rational behavior. They allow for informed decision making alongside distributional conflict. And they accommodate the supply side as well as the demand side when analyzing the choice of organizational forms (Krehbiel 1991, 122-23) Information and Legasleive Organizations 
{\S}remote majoritarian choices 
{\S}uncertiantly postulate, legislators know policy instrument but not effects – some instruments are more certain than others and some congressmen have more information than others --- outcome has a systematic component and a random component –everyone is endowed with beliefs which can be updated

{\textperiodcentered}Party incentives different than firm because they need 51{\%} - hotelling model does not apply beyond 2 parties 
{\textperiodcentered}Has two different explanations for why parties don't join at median 
o Extremists will sit out – not logical or factual, but even if we assume it, if we assume extremeist blocks can change their demands, the block with the less extreme demands wins, driving back to middle! P 113 
o Imperfect information, when parties get close, people cannot tell them apart and vote on other things, risking inialiation of one party (e.g. if the other party candidate is more charming) 
{\textperiodcentered}Given electors imperfect info, it pays a party to channel different info to different voters - “limits to the amount of confusion” 
{\textperiodcentered}Parties may also not occupy the same ideological point on every issue 
o If different people weight issues differently, 
o False dilemma 
o In two party system, you know what govt you are voting for but difficult to know what the parties would do because of their incentives to be vague 
o In a multy party system the parties are more precice but it is more difficult to tell what one is doing by voting for one (with respect to eventual govt coalition)

Downs 
{\textperiodcentered}“a party which perennially makes false promises can gain if it convinces voters to believe its lies. It is rational for this party to encourage voters to behave irrationally.”- Downs 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}‘Our model is based on the assumption that every government seeks to maximize political support.” 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}path “must not vitiate its opponents by economic policies aimed specifically at injuring them. Also it must economically uphold the voting rights of its citizens” 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}“Because each adult citizen has one vote, his welfare preferences are weighted in the eyes of the government, which is interested only in his vote, not in his welfare.” - p 18 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}“Theoretical models should be tested primarily by the accuracy of their predictions rather than the reality of their assumptions” 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}parties have no consistent preference ordering, resetting in a hodge lodge of policies 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}team of men who agree on all goals 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}“politicians in the real world sometimes act as they think best for society as a whole even when they know their actions will lose votes.” 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}In every field, no account of human behavior is complete without mention of such altruism; its possessors are among the heroes men rightly admire” 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}“politicians in our model never seek office as a means of carrying out particular policies; their only goal is to reap the rewards of holding office per se. They treat policies purely as means to the attainment of they private ends” 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}“the social function if fulfilled, as it were, incidentally—in the same sense as production is incidental to the making of profits.” - Schumpter 1950 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}“the creators of such models do not always consider whether the behavior they advocate as good is also rational in the economic sense. A man who is god in their eyes may be unable to perform his function in the division of labor efficiently. In fact. good behavior as they define it may e so inefficient that its prevalence in society would disrupt the very social state they desire.” ???????????? THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR SOCIETY IS DIVISION OF LABOR? 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}“any divergency he finds casts doubt on the feasibility of his prescriptions and therefore upon just how good they really are.” 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}“the incumbents always regard reelection as a mandate to continute their former policies.” NO, THEY RATIONALLY ANTICIPATE THE NEXT ELECTION 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}the outcome calls for change or no change” NO 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}“no matter how similar their policies in time t, if the opposition wins, it is sure to carry out policies different from those the imcimeants would have carried out” 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}SO HOW DO THE RESULTS/PREDICTIONS DIFFER IF WE ASSUME ELECTIONS ARE WON TO ADVANCE POLICY—MAXIMIZING A TOTALLY DIFFERENT VALUE 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}“rational men are not interested in parties per se, but in their own utility incomes” - Downs 42 
{\textperiodcentered}YEAT PARTY DICISIONMAKERS ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN PARTY SUCCESS. 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}“elections inevitably signal change or no change” 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}Downs proposes the performance ranking as a way to discriminate between parities with equal records. it is not at all clear why this information is not part of the expected utility in the first place. If it is, how does it help discriminate? - p 44 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}46- how voters change their minds “to decide what impact each government act has upon his income, he appraises it as good or pass in the light of his own view of “the good society” 
{\textperiodcentered}“Thus a man's evaluation of each party depends ultimately upon (1) the information he has about its policies and (2) the relation between those policies he knows about and his conception of a good society.” 
{\textperiodcentered}“he can be persuaded to change his mind oily if one of these two factors is altered” THIS IS SLIPRY, BECAUSE BEFORE IT WAS EXPECTED UTILITY, NOT IDEA OF A GOOD SOCIETY, IN PERFECT INFORMATION EXPECTED UTILITY CANNOT CHANGE, BUT IDEAS CAN??? 
{\textperiodcentered}“only new information can persuade him” 
{\textperiodcentered}- what about a presuated of a new deff of the good society ? 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}ASSUME FIXED POLITICAL TASTES 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}THEY ASK US TO EVALUATE THIS MODEL BY THE ACCURACY OF ITS PREDICTIONS, NOT ITS ASSUMPTIONS, DOES IT PREDICT???? HOW ARE WE TO KNOW IF IT HAS ASSUMPTIONS THAT CANNOT BE REPLICATED. THERE EXISTS NO WORLD WHERE WE CAN TEST THIS MODEL. 
{\textperiodcentered}ASSUMPTOIONS NOT JUST ABOUT HOW PEOPLE REASON, BUT ABOUT THE STATE OF THE WORLD 
{\textperiodcentered}CHAPTER 8: THE STATICS AND DYNAMICS OF PARTY IDEOLOGIES 
o New parties can be most successfully launched immediately after significant change in distribution of ideological views – IS POLITICS AND ACTIONS OF PARTIES NOT A FACTOR IN CHANGE IN VIEWS? 
o “In two party system it is rational for each aprty to encourage voters to be irrational by making its platform vague and ambiguous” p 115 
o number of parites depends on distribution of voters – CLEARLY WRONG FOR WINNER TAKE ALL},

abstract = {"Civilian control of the military is a basic principle of the American Con- stitution"; so runs the commonplace. It is the thesis of this article that the (liche could hardly be more inaccurate, for actually the American Constitution in the twentieth century obstructs the achievement of civilian control. It is well known that civil supremacy was a major concern of the Framers. They provided for it in the only form in which they knew it. But civilian control in the eighteenth century is very different from civilian control in the twentieth century: the Constitution which was expertly designed to provide for it then, for this very reason, frustrates it now. In presenting this thesis, it is necessary: (1) to show how the meaning of civilian control has changed over the inter- vening years; (2) to describe the Framers' concept and show how it was em- 1)odied in the Constitution; and (3) to demonstrate how the provisions which they thought would guarantee it impair its effectiveness today},
annote = {Huntington 
{\textperiodcentered}President as commander and chief is not a military under civilian control 
o Subjective control – military is citizens 
o Objective control – military obeys state 
{\textperiodcentered}Meaning of civilian control has changed 
o Standing army (monarchy) and citizen militia 
o Professional standing army is a new thing—not monarchic or democratic 
o Created the modern problem of civilian-military relations 
{\S}Requires military to obstain from politics 
{\textperiodcentered}Framers conception is embedded in constitution – did not envision professional military or objective control 
o Imagined political control over the uses to which military may be applied, not over military itself

{\textperiodcentered}“The seeds of formal analytic political science were planted a half-century ago with the publication of {\textregistered}ve major works: Ken Arrow's (1951) Social Choice and Individual Values, Duncan Black's (1958) The Theory of Committees and Elections, Anthony Downs's (1957) An Economic Theory of Democracy, William Riker's (1962) The Theory of Political Coalitions and Buchanan and Tullock's (1962) The Calculus of Consent. Approximately midway between this germination of rational choice politics and the present, Kenneth Shepsle (1979) published `Institutional Arrangements and Equilibrium in Multi- dimensional Voting Models'. {\ldots}formal theorists as of 1980 began to worry less about analytic properties of relatively unconstrained social choice environments and began to think more about factors that seem to constrain decision- makers who engage in collective choice. = New Institutionalism `institutions matter'. 
{\textperiodcentered}The purpose of this essay is to clarify the nature and purpose of this research program {\ldots}Our core argument is that institutionalism is more of a method than a mission. 
{\textperiodcentered}New equilibrium concept – changes results and which puzzels are interesting (ie not chaios) 
{\textperiodcentered}Empirical testing becomes essential .. tests that discriminate between groups of theories that share methodo- logical but not substantive assumptions is crucial to the viability of the method. 
{\textperiodcentered}implication of the perspective of institution- alism as a method is that there is no such thing as `the theory of rational choice' 
{\textperiodcentered}should not presuppose that different contextual features have different consequences for outcomes. 
{\textperiodcentered}suggest only that the line be drawn comfortably on the {\textregistered}rm side of mere patterns of behavior. 
{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}Do parties matter? 
o No excuse for missing this on exam 
o Only three things – krheble, aldrech, rhode 
{\S}Krebiel type model = median of coalition, median of committee, etc 
{\S}{\S}{\textperiodcentered}Krehbiel 
o Assumptions 
{\S}You can plot congressmen on a line 
{\S}There is an exogenous status quo 
{\S}The actors are pres and members (one camberial) 
{\S}They have a single peaked preference on that dimension 
o Procedures: Veto/cloture 
o Full convergance: policy shifts to median 
o Parital convergance: policy shifits toward the median, but only so far as veto or fillabuster pivot 
o Gridlock 
{\textperiodcentered}Chapter 3 test one 
o Members move 
o Get more bills passed 
{\textperiodcentered}Chapter 4 test two 
o president changes = 
o large majorities 
{\textperiodcentered}Chapter 5 test three 
o Fillabusters should not happen, but since they do, tests predictions about when they do

 that advances in information technology will greatly expand public
 participation in regulatory policymaking. They claim that e-
 rulemaking, or the application of new technology to administrative
 rulemaking, promises to transform a previously insulated process into
 one in which ordinary citizens regularly provide input With the
 federal government having implemented several e-rulemaking
 initiatives in recent years, we can now begin to assess whether such a
 transformation is in the works - or even on the horizon. This paper
 compares empirical observations on citizen participation in the past,
 before e-rulemaking, with more recent data on citizen participation
 after the introduction of various types of technological innovations.
 Contrary to prevailing predictions, empirical research shows that e-
 rulemaking makes little difference: citizen input remains typically
 sparse, notwithstanding the relative ease with which individuals can
 now learn about and comment on regulatory proposals. These
 findings indicate that the more significant barriers to citizen
 participation are cognitive and motivational Even with e-rulemaking,
 it takes a high level of technical sophistication to understand and
 comment on regulatory proceedings. Moreover, even though
 information technology lowers the absolute cost of submitting
 comments to regulatory agencies, it also dramatically decreases the

abstract = {Distrust in intellectuals has pervaded American culture for centuries. This distrust, however, has
not led to a similar distrust in the scientific community. Aggregate trust and belief in science has
remained relatively stable over time. Recently, however, a partisan divide has formed in
judgements about science, the scientific community, and science issues such as policies
concerning climate change. Research on the relationship between science and politics has
focused on how partisan affiliations shape individual judgements about these scientific issues
and finds that partisan affiliations strongly influence an individual's judgments about science
issues and science-related policies. These efforts assume that partisan affiliations shape scientific
judgements. But attitudes about science may be more embedded than previously thought. I argue
that an individual's belief about the merits of science, called science efficacy, is a deep-seated,
central worldview. Instead of being a result of partisan affiliations, I find that science efficacy
consistently shapes partisan affiliations. Using longitudinal cross-sectional and panel survey
data, I demonstrate that science efficacy has a significant unidirectional impact on individual
partisanship and that this relationship is robust to accounting for science-based policy positions.
Taken together these results suggest science efficacy is central to partisan identity and is
increasingly important in the American political landscape.},

The reasons proffered for delay are numerous, often centering on procedural hurdles or bureaucrats' ineptitude. I offer a different perspective on delay in one important bureaucratic venue: the federal rulemaking process. I argue that agencies can speed up (fast-track) or slow down (slow-roll) the rulemaking process in order to undermine political oversight provided by Congress, the president, and the courts. That is, when the political climate is favorable agencies rush to lock in a rule, but when it is less favorable they "wait out" the tenure of current political overseers. I find empirical support for this proposition using an event history analysis of more than 9,600 agency rules from 147 agencies. The results support the interpretation that agencies strategically delay, and that delay is not simply evidence of increased bureaucratic effort.},

@misc{Young2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Purpose: Responsible sourcing of metals is characterized as an approach for life cycle management (LCM) and sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) of social issues. The focus is on the supply of “conflict minerals”—tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG)—whose mining and trade are implicated in conflict and severe social conditions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Downstream manufacturers are using compliance strategies to reach multiple tiers and long distances into product chains to buy conflict-free sources of these metals from mines, smelters, and refineries. Methods: The research uses qualitative methods and public documents to compare 16 conflict mineral programs. A theoretical framework in three dimensions guided the enquiry into program governance, program standards, and certification processes. Additional empirical analysis of the conflict-free sourcing program, the largest and most central industry-led effort on conflict minerals, was supported by confidential access to audit reports, company policies, and management procedures on more than 140 metallurgical facilities. Results and discussion: In fewer than 4 years, conflict-free sourcing programs have impacted global 3TG metal supply chains, as indicated by pricing and significant producer compliance. Electronics, jewelry, and other manufacturers—many influenced by US conflict mineral regulation—are “pulling” metals markets for conflict-free sourcing. Private standard programs focus on product chain chokepoints to support efficient engagement: a limited number of 3TG facilities that are influenced to implement “responsibility management systems,” practice conflict-free sourcing, and undergo compliance audits. Some supply chains operate as closed pipelines along the full product chain from mine to end-product. Tantalum has been most successful as about 95 {\%} of producers are compliant; however, for gold, in particular, the scale of compliance is challenged. Conclusions: Downstream manufacturing industries are “governing at a distance” the management practices of upstream raw material producers. For LCM, responsible sourcing may be applicable to product chains with other metals and commodities. For SSCM, conflict-free sourcing indicates how compliance and supplier development strategies can penetrate multiple tiers into supply chains to address social issues in developing countries. Future research is needed on understanding more on supplier companies and their motivations and on sustainability performance outcomes for the conflict mineral problem.},

@misc{Vuori2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited. The chapter aims to compare public, private and non-profit working citizens' preferences for cross-sectoral relations in England and Finland. Its main contribution is in identifying preferences in the delivery of services in the respective countries in which citizen choice has become an issue in times of public sector austerity. Challenges arise because in these two similarly institutionalized healthcare systems but pluralistic societies people have contrasting perspectives on the values that should guide policy decisions. The survey data was therefore collected in both England (N = 2,000) and Finland (N = 1,973) in 2013 from cities in which citizens have choices regarding health service delivery. Our informants in England anticipated more potential for better ‘privatized driven public interest' than did those in Finland. Surprisingly, over 60{\%} of public sector employees in England would like forprofit healthcare to carry main responsibility, and almost 55{\%} of all employees agree with this. Almost 20{\%} of respondents in both countries did not care who the service provider is if only services are available. Thus, the research has pioneering relevance for policymaking, public strategic management and the comparative empirical study of managing people's preferences in cross-sectoral relations. We conclude that identifying working citizens' preferences is crucial for effective utilization of current welfare services because the preferences derive from both service and work experience. In sum, strategically, this identification lets public managers balance biased images of the cross-sectoral differences and reconstruct functional hybridity of services.},

@unpublished{Grabs2018,
abstract = {The emergence of scholarship on private regulatory governance in a variety of
disciplines has led to a rich, hitherto underappreciated range of theoretical lenses.
These diverse lenses differ in their focal scope and ontological assumptions and
through their application come to diverging conclusions on the evolution of private
governance, its problem-solving potential and resulting public policy implications.
This article presents six such lenses (calculated strategic behavior, experimentalism,
learning and deliberative processes, political institutionalism, convention theory and
global value chains, and Neo-Gramscian perspectives), and reviews what they
illustrate and obfuscate, respectively, in the illustrative case of private forestry
governance. It then compares the theoretical lenses' focal scopes and select
ontological assumptions, and explores implications for theory-building, the validity of
findings, and public policy advice. Finally, it argues that the continued siloization of
approaches within their respective disciplines undermines our collective
comprehension of the influence/effectiveness and policy relevance of private
regulatory governance. To address this challenge, andit calls for greater interaction
and the occasional ‘switching' of lenses for an enhanced understanding of private
regulatory governance's problem-solving potential.},

abstract = {In countries marked by the growing uptake of non-state market driven (NSMD)
governance for agricultural commodities (i.e., eco-labels and certification systems), forested
areas are steadily declining while crop lands are growing. Deforestation continues despite
NSMD rules strictly prohibiting the conversion of forested land to agriculture. In this paper, we
ask why the growing presence of NSMD governance has coincided with ongoing deforestation.
While the seeming inability of NSMD governance to halt broader patterns of land use change
can be partially explained by a lack of market uptake, there are also a range of other variables
that may contribute to this relationship. We probe five hypotheses through comparative case
studies of sustainable soy certification in Brazil, palm oil in Indonesia, and cocoa in C{\^{o}}te
d'Ivoire. Our plausibility probe indicates that NSMD governance has neither abetted, nor
hindered, the conversion of forested land to agricultural production. We find strong evidence that
a lack of broad market uptake limits the effectiveness of NSMD governance. However, we also
find evidence that regulatory loopholes in NSMD systems may explain the inability of eco-labels
and certification systems to halt broader patterns of land use change in countries with
comparatively strong market uptake. Our results highlight critical problems related to expanding
the reach and stringency of NSMD governance alongside ongoing fragmentation of global
environmental governance. The study contributes to scholarship on the impact and effectiveness
of transnational environmental governance.},

abstract = {We conducted e-mail surveys of organizations that had received forest management certification under the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) in the United States and Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) in the United States and Canada to determine if forest certification has changed forest management practices and if the changes are practically and statistically different between systems. The results indicate that forest certification prompted substantial changes in practices. On average, firms implemented 13‐14 changes in forestry, environmental, social, and economic/system practices to obtain or maintain forest certification. Although there was no statistical difference between systems in the total number of changes, there were many differences in the implementation of specific forest practices, with FSC firms required to make more environmental/forest management changes and SFI firms required to make more economic/system changes. Forest managers believed that the benefits of forest certification were greater than the disadvantages. SFI managers rated the benefits of forest certification higher than FSC managers, but also rated the disadvantages higher. Most organizations felt certification accomplished their objectives and were likely to recertify, thus indicating their endorsement of the process.

@book{Vogel2006,
abstract = {In the highly praised The Market for Virtue, David Vogel presents a clear, balanced analysis of the contemporary corporate social responsibility (CSR) movement in the United States and Europe. In this updated paperback edition, Vogel discusses recent CSR initiatives and responds to new developments in the CSR debate. He asserts that while the movement has achieved success in improving some labor, human rights, and environmental practices in developing countries, there are limits to improving corporate conduct without more extensive and effective government regulation. Put simply, Vogel believes that there is a market for virtue, but it is limited by the substantial costs of socially responsible business behavior. Praise for the cloth edition: “The definitive guide to what corporate social responsibility can and cannot accomplish in a modern capitalist economy.”—Robert B. Reich, Brandeis University, and former U.S. Secretary of Labor “Vogel raises a number of excellent points on the present and future of CSR.”—Working Knowledge, Harvard Business School “A useful corrective to the view that CSR alone is the full answer to social problems.”—Business Ethics “The study combines sound logic with illustrative cases, and advances the sophistication of the CSR debate considerably.” —John G. Ruggie, Harvard University, co-architect of UN Global Compact

@article{Cashore2002,
abstract = {In recent years, transnational and domestic nongovernmental organizations have created non–state market–driven (NSMD) governance systems whose purpose is to develop and implement environmentally and socially responsible management practices. Eschewing traditional state authority, these systems and their supporters have turned to the market's supply chain to create incentives and force companies to comply. This paper develops an analytical framework designed to understand better the emergence of NSMD governance systems and the conditions under which they may gain authority to create policy. Its theoretical roots draw on pragmatic, moral, and cognitive legitimacy granting distinctions made within organizational sociology, while its empirical focus is on the case of sustainable forestry certification, arguably the most advanced case of NSMD governance globally. The paper argues that such a framework is needed to assess whether these new private governance systems might ultimately challenge existing state–centered authority and public policy–making processes, and in so doing reshape power relations within domestic and global environmental governance.

abstract = {We propose Hetero-Labeled LDA (hLLDA), a novel semi-supervised topic model, which can learn from multiple types of labels such as document labels and feature labels (i.e., heterogeneous labels), and also accommodate labels for only a subset of classes (i.e., partial labels). This addresses two major limitations in existing semi-supervised learning methods: they can incorporate only one type of domain knowledge (e.g. document labels or feature labels), and they assume that provided labels cover all the classes in the problem space. This limits their applicability in real-life situations where domain knowledge for labeling comes in different forms from different groups of domain experts and some classes may not have labels. hLLDA resolves both the label heterogeneity and label partialness problems in a unified generative process.

hLLDA can leverage different forms of supervision and discover semantically coherent topics by exploiting domain knowledge mutually reinforced by different types of labels. Experiments with three document collections–Reuters, 20 Newsgroup and Delicious– validate that our model generates a better set of topics and efficiently discover additional latent topics not covered by the labels resulting in better classification and clustering accuracy than existing supervised or semi-supervised topic models. The empirical results demonstrate that learning from multiple forms of domain knowledge in a unified process creates an enhanced combined effect that is greater than a sum of multiple models learned separately with one type of supervision.},

abstract = {This article uses Twitter messages sent in May 2011 to study the ability of the so-called 15-M movement, a “connective” movement, to place their demands on the media agenda and maintain control over their own discourse. The results show that the activists' discourse included many issues, although greatest attention was given to three: electoral and party systems, democracy and governance, and civil liberties. Moreover, the study reveals that the media covered all the movement's issues and that activists maintained their plural discourse throughout the protest. This article contributes to the literature on ‘connective' social movements, showing that in certain circumstances these movements have the capacity to determine media coverage.

abstract = {What effect does regulatory auditing by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
(OIRA) have on the production of regulations in the agencies? In particular, does targeting an
agency for heavy regulatory auditing inhibit its production of regulations, a “chilling” effect?
Does heavy auditing encourage it to substitute multiple small regulations in place of single large
one, “OIRA avoidance”? We present an early empirical analysis of these questions by estimating
regulation production functions for federal agencies, using data from the Unified Agenda
from 1995 to 2010. We attempt to distinguish the differential effects of regulatory auditing
from appointments into the agencies, leveraging off exogenous variation created by independent
regulatory commissions. Our data uncover no evidence of a chilling effect in the production of
economically significant regulations due to the Bush administration's regulatory auditing,
relative to the Clinton or early Obama administrations. Nor do we find any evidence of OIRA
avoidance. We do find some evidence that the Bush administration reduced the production of
noneconomically significant regulations overall. However, the effect appears to be due to appointments
in the agencies. Overall, the results raise questions about the efficacy of presidential efforts
to control the regulatory state and how best to evaluate those efforts.},

abstract = { The impact of the bureaucracy on policy programs through
 the use of discretion has been both applauded and bemoaned by
 scholars. By examining variation in the implementation of the
 Social Security Disability program in the fifty states, this article
 explores the impact of state level environmental characteristics on
 the use of discretion. Specifically this article tests whether street-
 level bureaucracies respond to local economic, political, and task
 factors. The case of Social Security Disability is particularly
 interesting because state officials have an incentive to increase
 the number of disability recipients since the federal government
 funds the entire program. The findings in the article indicate that
 variation in the implementation of the Social Security Disability
 program is a function of levels of need for benefits, the health of
 the economy, and state partisan politics. Taken together the find-
 ings suggest that professional norms play a large role in directing
 the ways that street-level bureaucrats use their discretion. The
 implementation of the Social Security program is not, however,
 apolitical. While the bureaucracy is professional, it is also
 responsive to local political concerns. Although street-level
 bureaucracies seem open to influence from political officials, they
 do not respond to fiscal stress on state governments nor to high
 levels of social commitments. This indicates that state govern-
 ments do not use the disability program strategically, but play a
 more indirect role by creating an environment that is ideological-
 ly more or less generous with regard to s},

We outline and test an empirical model of federal regulatory behavior that reflects the spatial (i.e., interstate) and temporal dimensions of regulation within a federal system. A pooled time-series design is used to examine the interplay of national and subnational influences on the oversight decisions of officials at the U.S. Office of Surface Mining (OSM, Department of the Interior) during the period 1985-1989. The analysis indicates that the regulatory decisions of federal authorities at OSM reflect shifts in the nation's political climate, the freelancing efforts of individual members of Congress, and the states' political climates. Taken together, the findings suggest that national policymakers are able to direct the oversight activities of bureaucratic subordinates but are constrained in that regard by "bottom up" influences.},

He asserts that low-level bureaucrats (teachers, police officers, social workers, etc.) engage in direct policy making and political action in their interactions with clients. Contrary to Kaufman's vision of the Forestry Service, with strong institutional control and centralized policy, Lipsky 's street level bureaucrats often engage in a significant level of policy interpretation and make determinations of policy implementation without the guidance of a centralized authority. These individuals h ave to simplify and routinize their behavior and client interaction in order to balance massive caseloads and the result is often that street level policy and statute diverge. Differences in policy implementation, and variation between individual cases, serves to undermine the sense of fairness and effectiveness on the part of state clients.

abstract = {Ainsworth et al. look at the use of signing statements as a means of asserting pr esidential power, but situate that action within the context of the Congressional response it inspires. Leveraging signing statement data from 1995 to 2007, they find evidence that congressional committees with the relevant agency oversight react to the nu mber of objections raised by signing statements, and rather simply ceding authority to the President, will instead respond with a greater degree of oversight. They theorize that Congress uses the signing statement as a declaration that the President will m ove away from the legislative intent during the implementation of the law. 

ABSTRACT: Popular and scholarly accounts argue that signing statements are important tools for presidents to shape the implementation of policy. Although signing statements might be important presidential tools, the legislative branch stands in the most immediate and direct competition with the executive for ultimate control of the bureaucracy. In this article, we assess whether congressional committees react to presidential signing statements with increased oversight. Using a data set that includes every oversight hearing held by the U.S. House between 1995 and 2007, we find evidence that congressional committees are sensitive to the number of objections raised by presidents in signing statements. As the president uses signing statements to object to a larger number of provisions in laws, the affected House committees respond with more oversight.},

This work is a follow up to the earlier work of Moe and Howell (1999), among others. One of the central conclusions is that agencies with greater numbers of political appointees have consistently lower Program Assessment Rating Tool grades, which speaks to the impact of politicization on bureaucratic efficacy and competence. Lewis' work is also noteworthy because of the data sets he employed in his analysis; he leverages the Office of Personnel Management's personnel data files to mak e the distinction between career civil servants and political appointees. Reviews of the work have noted that this constitutes the most comprehensive inventory of political appointees at the federal level (William Howell, Political Science Quarterly, 182).

@article{Howell2002b,
abstract = {Scholars have largely ignored one of the most important ways in which presidents influence the administrative state in the modern era, that is, by creating administrative agencies through executive action. Because they can act unilaterally, presidents alter the kinds of administrative agencies that are created and the control they wield over the federal bureaucracy. We analyze the 425 agencies established between 1946 and 1995 and find that agencies created by administrative action are significantly less insulated from presidential control than are agencies created through legislation. We also find that the ease of congressional legislative action is a significant predictor of the number of agencies created by executive action. We conclude that the very institutional factors that make it harder for Congress to legislate provide presidents new opportunities to create administrative agencies on their own, and to design them in ways that maximize executive control.

Lewis and Howell examine 425 new agencies created between 1946 and 1995 (1096) by the exercise of unilateral executive action and de monstrate that bureaucracies created under the guise of executive action are much more susceptible to p residential control. They also find an inverse relationship between congressional strength and unilateral activity, meaning that when Congress is stronge st, the executive is much less likely to act unilaterally. As they state, “these findings suggest that the very institutional factors that undermine Congress augment presidential influence and control (1096).” This work marks an interesting change in direc tion for the presidential literature, which prior to this article has focused primarily on presidential control of agencies already in existence. },

@article{VantVeld2011,
abstract = {This paper treats programs in which firms voluntarily agree to meet environmental standards as “green clubs”: clubs, because they provide non-rival but excludable reputation benefits to participating firms; green, because they also generate environmental public goods. The model illuminates a central tension between the congestion externality familiar from conventional club theory and the free-riding externality familiar from the theory on private provision of public goods. We compare three common program sponsors—governments, industry, and environmental groups. We find that if monitoring of the club standard is perfect, a government constrained from regulating club size may prefer to leave sponsorship to industry if public-good benefits are sufficiently low, or to environmentalists if public-good benefits are sufficiently high. If monitoring is imperfect, an important question is whether consumers can infer that a club is too large for its standard to be credible. If they can then the government may deliberately choose an imperfect monitoring mechanism as a way of regulating club size indirectly. If they cannot then this reinforces the government's preference for delegating sponsorship.},
