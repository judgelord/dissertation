Incorperating political information allows us to begin formalizing
intuitions about mechanisms of influence. For example, @Libgober2018
asks "What proportion of commenting activity can be characterized as
informing regulators about public preferences versus attempting to
attract attention of other political principals?" (p. 29). Adding
political information to the model allows us to formalize this question:
Under what conditions does the decision to comment depend on an
organization's beliefs about $\alpha_t$ versus beliefs about $\alpha_s$?
Empirically, we may often be able to infer that the difference in
commenting can be attributed to group $i$'s beliefs about $\alpha_{si}$
if the behavior of political principals varies but other observed
parameter values are similar across rules at a given agency.

Rational-choice explanations of why organizations comment on proposed
rules build on an intuition that potential commenters will comment only
when the benefits exceed the costs of doing so. This intuition ought to
apply to other lobbying strategies such as public pressure campaigns as well.
Adding an additional lobbying strategy into the model described above is
straightforward. In Libgober's model, a potential commenter has negative
quadratic preferences centered on their ideal policy $p_i$ and
$u_i = -(x_f - p_i)^2$ where $x_f$ is the final policy chosen by the
agency decisonmakers. An organization will comment if the cost of doing so is less
than the difference between their utility when agency decisionmakers select a
policy having been informed about the organization's ideal point $p_i$
versus when the they select a policy having made a guess about the
organization's ideal point, $z_i$. If $c_i$ is organization $i$'s cost
of commenting, then $i$ will comment if it expects to be better off
providing information than abstaining
$E[u_i | p_i] > E[u_i | z_i] + c_i$. Similarly, an organization will go
public when it expects that the cost of running a mass mobilization
campaign to be less than the difference in utility when agency officials
select a policy having been informed about the intensity of broader
public preferences $p_{public}$ versus when agency officials select a policy
having made a guess about the intensity of the attentive public's
preferences, $z_{public}$. If $c_{campaign, i}$ is organization $i$'s
cost of running a mass mobilization campaign, then $i$ will launch a
campaign if
$E[u_i | p_{public}] > E[u_i | z_{public}] + c_{campaign, i}$. This
suggests that public pressure tactics should be more common when agency officials are either poorly
informed or distant from public opinion and potentially influenced by
the types of political information created by public pressure campaigns.

Additionally, an organization may comment or run a mass mobilization
campaign if it benefits in ways that are independent of policy outcomes.
Strategies such as "going down fighting" can be incorporated by adding
exogenous benefit parameters to the utility function of the potential
commenter/mobilizer. Let $v_i$ be the benefit of commenting independent
of its effect on the policy outcome, such as pleasing members or to
reserving the right to sue. Let $w_i$ be the benefit of running a mass
mobilization campaign independent of its effect on the outcome of the
policy at hand, such as fulfilling expectations of existing members or
recruiting new members. An organizations utility function would then be
$u_i = -(x - p_i)^2 + v_i + w_i$.

The result of commenting
without rule change also becomes possible if commenters are allowed a
strategy of "going down fighting" and incentives to do so.
