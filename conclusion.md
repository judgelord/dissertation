%This research will add to our understanding of how  bureaucratic policymaking fits with the practice of democracy.
%-->
The legitimacy of bureaucratic policymaking is said to depend on the premise that rulemaking provides for public voice [@Croley2003, @Rosenbloom2003]. Yet we lack an empirical base necessary to evaluate whether any legitimacy the public comment process may provide is deserved. If input solicited from ordinary people has little effect on policy outcomes, directly or indirectly, it may be best understood as providing a veneer of democratic legitimacy on an essentially technocratic and/or elite-driven process. I have made a few initial steps toward better understanding actual public engagement in bureaucratic policymaking.
If public pressure campaigns do shape agency decisions, a new research program will be needed to investigate who exactly these campaigns mobilize and represent.
