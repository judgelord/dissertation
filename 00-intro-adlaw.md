### Administrative Law Scholarship {-} 

In contrast to political scientists, legal scholars have long debated
what to make of mass commenting in rulemaking. In 2018, the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS)
    identified public pressure campaigns ("mass commenting")" as a top issue in administrative law. In
    their report to ACUS, @SantAmbrogio2018 conclude, 
    
> "The 'mass comments' occasionally submitted in great volume in highly salient
    rulemakings are one of the more vexing challenges facing agencies in
    recent years. Mass comments are typically the result of orchestrated
    campaigns by advocacy groups to persuade members or other
    like-minded individuals to express support for or opposition to an
    agency's proposed rule." 

Most administrative law scholars focus on reforms to
help agencies collect more useful information
[@Farina2011; @Farina2014; @Rauch2016]. The ACUS report "explores agency strategies to enhance public engagement prior to and during informal rulemaking. It seeks to ensure that agencies invest
 resources in a way that maximizes the probability that rulewriters
 obtain high-quality public information."
Among other things, this committee is debating how best to gather
"quality public information," how "to get new people/groups into the
real or virtual room" [@Farina2018], and whether broad engagement is
even desirable on all rules [@White2018].

Administrative law scholars have explored these questions theoretically
for decades, but only a few offer empirical analysis. @Mendelson2011
finds that agencies often discard non-technical comments but argues that
they should be given more weight. Others worry that mass commenting
distracts agencies from good policy and the broader public interest
[@Coglianese2006]. @Farina2012 [p. 112] claim that "[Mass] comments
typically are neither factually informative nor reliable indicators of
citizens' informed value preferences." Some even call them "spam"
[@Balla2018; @Noveck2004]. In this prevailing view, "high-quality" and
"relevant" mean novel technical information, not opinions. @Herz2016 [p.
208] concludes "The goal of e-rulemaking is to more fully capture such
credible, specific, and relevant information, not to solicit the views
of random, self-nominating members of the public." Similarly,
@Epstein2014 [p. 4] dismiss mass comments as "effectively, votes rather
than informational or analytical contributions. Rulemaking agencies are
legally required to make policy decisions based on fact-based, reasoned
analysis rather than majority sentiment; hence, even hundreds of
thousands of such comments have little value in the rulemaking process."
Notably, the ACUS draft recommendations on "Mass and Fake Comments in
Agency Rulemaking" suggests that "effective comments" give "reasons
rather than just reactions" [@ACUS2018 p. 33]. If true, most public
reactions to proposed rules such as those expressed in the mass comments generated by public pressure campaigns would have no effect in rulemaking.

Early optimism among legal scholars that the internet would "change
everything" [@Johnson1998] and that "cyberdemocracy" would enable more
deliberative rulemaking has faded. While commenting and mobilizing
others to comment has become easier, @Coglianese2006 concludes that little
else has changed. Predictions by @Sunstein2001 and others that the internet would primarily
facilitate more of the same kind of engagement among the like-minded
(i.e. mass-commenting)  has largely been correct. In this
sense, the "quality" of discourse has not improved.

Even scholars who suggest reforms aimed at "regulatory democracy" aim to
increase the "sophistication" of ordinary peoples' comments
[e.g., @Cuellar2005; @Johnson2013]. For example, @Noveck2004 is critical of "notice and spam," arguing instead for
"participative practices---methods for 'doing democracy' that build the
skills and capacity necessary for citizens, experts, and organizations
to speak and to be heard. Rulemaking, after all, is a communicative
process involving a dialogue between regulators and those affected by
regulation" [@Noveck2005, pg. 3]. These reformers see mass espressions of opinion as worse than unhelpful. They argue that we need better, more sophisticated citizens to engage in informed discourse that tells policymakers things they do not already know. 

This scholarship has improved the theory and practice of policy learning
in bureaucratic policymaking. But a focus on sophisticated deliberation and technical
information overlooks the potential role of political information---information about the politial context in which policymakers make decisions.^[But see insights from @Golden1998, @Nelson2012, @Rauch2016, and
    @Potter2017 on political information, @Cuellar2005 on participation
    and voice, and @Reich1966 and @Seifter2016UCLA on representation,
    which I review in \@ref(why-theory).]
Whereas administrative law scholars have focused on "how technology can
connect the expertise of the many to the power of the few"
[@Noveck2009], I ask whether it may also connect the power of the many
to the decisions of the few.
