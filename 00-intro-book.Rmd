<!-- DEMOCRACY has problems and bureaucratic solutions-->
Large democracies face two big problems. First, they are vulnerable to fleeting passions and demagogues. To combat this, many decisions are left to experts who, ideally, exercise judgment loosely guided by the public. Second, everyone cannot vote on every decision. We thus delegate power to representatives (who then delegate it to deputies), create temporary mini-publics, or solicit input from those most affected or moved by a public decision.^[As imagined by @Dahl1989, mini-publics are representative, selected at random, and deliberative. Besides juries, however, randomly selected deliberative bodies are rare. Instead, citizens more often engage in government decisions when given opportunities to opt-in, such as hearings, petitions, and public comment periods. These mechanisms of engagement generate a different, more contentious flavor of public input than the discourse imagined by scholars who focus on deliberation.] Most policy is then made by bureaucrats, supposedly guided indirectly through elected representatives and directly by limited public input. Of the thousand of policies that the institutoins of government make each year, direct public input tends to be limited to only the very most contentious policy debates.

Both of these problems converge in the bureaucracy. Bureacracies are run by experts who are deputized by elected officials (or by their deputy's deputy's deputy). Many bureacracies also have procedures that create opportunities for public input, and it is far from clear how bureaucratic decisions are to balance expertise, accountability to elected officials, and responsiveness to public input in decisionmaking.

Participatory processes like public comment periods, where government
agencies must solicit public input on draft policies, are said to
provide political oversight opportunities [@Balla1998; @McCubbins1984],
democratic legitimacy [@Croley2003; @Rosenbloom2003], and new technical
information [@Yackee2006JPART; @Nelson2012]. While recent scholarship on
agency policymaking has shed light on the sophisticated lobbying by
businesses and political insiders, we know surprisingly little about the
vast majority of public comments which are submitted by ordinary people
as part of public pressure campaigns.

In 2018, the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS)
    identified mass commenting as a top issue in administrative law. In
    their report to ACUS, @SantAmbrogio2018 conclude, "The 'mass
    comments' occasionally submitted in great volume in highly salient
    rulemakings are one of the more vexing challenges facing agencies in
    recent years. Mass comments are typically the result of orchestrated
    campaigns by advocacy groups to persuade members or other
    like-minded individuals to express support for or opposition to an
    agency's proposed rule." Mass comment campaigns are known to drive
    significant participation of ordinary people in Environmental
    Protection Agency rulemaking
    [@Judge-Lord2019; @Potter2017; @Balla2018]. @Cuellar2005, who
    examines public input on three rules, finds that ordinary people
    made up the majority of commenters demonstrating "demand among the
    mass public for a seat at the table in the regulatory process." 

    
Activists frequently target
agency policymaking with letter-writing campaigns, petitions, protests,
and mobilizing people to attend hearings, all classic examples of "civic
engagement" [@Verba1987]. As I show in \@ref{why-results}, most comments submitted to
    regulations.gov are form comments, more akin to petition signatures
    than sophisticated lobbying. Indeed, approximately 40 million out of
    50 million (80%) of these public comments mobilized by just 100
    advocacy organizations.
    Yet civic engagement remains poorly understood
in the context of bureaucratic policymaking.

These occasional bursts of civic engagement in bureaucratic policymaking
raise practical and theoretical questions for the practice of
democracy. 
These questions, in turn, hinge on unanswered empirical
questions: Do these campaigns affect policy? If so, by what mechanisms?
Existing research finds that commenters believe their comments matter
[@Yackee2015JPART] and that the number of public comments varies across
agencies and policy processes
[@Judge-Lord2019; @Libgober2018; @Moore2017], but the relationship
between the scale of public engagement and policy change remains
untested. Indeed, we have much to understand about the causes
and effects of these campaigns before we are in a position to ask if
they are a mechanism for groups to influence policy. Most critically, we
must understand who mobilizes public pressure campaigns and why.
