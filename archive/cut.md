rulemaking [@Coglianese2001], but **this intuition has yet to be tested.**-->





<!-- OLD INTRO 
This dissertation explores the role of public pressure campaigns in U.S. federal agency rulemaking, a technocratic policy process where "public participation" is usually limited to sophisticated lobbying but occasionally includes millions of people mobilized by public pressure campaigns. Public comment periods on proposed policies purport to provide democratic accountability. Yet, theories of bureaucratic policymaking largely ignore the occasional bursts of civic engagement that generate the vast majority of public comments on proposed rules. To fill this gap, I build and test theories about the role of public pressure in policymaking. I collect and analyze millions of public comments to develop the first systematic measures of civic engagement and influence in bureaucratic policymaking. -->

Who are these well-resourced groups?  
Do they lobby in other venues (like congressional policymaking)?  
Why should we consider these very select groups and their actions democratizing?  Perhaps they – themselves – are quite elitist?  Take this question head-on.  Maybe digging into the literature on membership groups would help here.  
Are super mobilizers different from others?

TODO: FROM SUSAN: 
-more about very few “policy advocacy organizations” that organize much of the mass commenting activity AND the “ordinary citizens” that are activated to submit a comment.  We need at least 1 or 2 very meaty paragraph(s) with many citations to past literature.  For example, “XXX (2013) used data on ___ to investigate policy advocacy organizations and found that they tend to ____.  In contrast, XXX (1975; see also XX, XX, XX) demonstrate that aren’t typically membership organizations because _____.  In sum, the interest group literature points to ____ as major factors in driving ____(see:  XXX, XXX, and XXX), but we still don’t fully understand how activity by these types of organizations might matter to bureaucracy policymaking, especially rulemaking.”  Put differently, what does the literature tell us about these groups and their lobbying?  This should explain what we currently know.  

These groups seem special, but I don’t know how (other than they are mostly environmental groups).  

Also, there must be policy advocacy organizations that don’t participate in rulemaking.  Why?  I DON'T KNOW!

Do all policy advocacy organizations use mass campaigns sometimes?  NO.

why is this so focused on environmental politics?  DIFFUSE PUBLIC INTERESTS REQUIRES MOBILIZATION.

Is there a threshold effect – groups need to have some funds to organize mass commenting campaigns.  What does that look like?  If that’s the case, then should we really consider them “less-resourced” (see abstract on page 42)?  How are we supposed to understand more or less-resourced (or is this just a proxy for private versus public)? CITE LOBBYING DONATIONS

CUT FROM WHY MOBILIZE FOR NOW


A key insight from scholarship on interest group lobbying in bureaucratic policymaking is that
technical information is the currency of insider lobbying [@Wagner2010]. 
<!--TODO-->
Figure
\@ref(fig:causal-classic2) illustrates what I call the ``classic
model" of insider lobbying that describes most rulemakings and nearly all
scholarship on lobbying in bureaucratic policymaking to date. Diamonds indicate observable choices, <!---ovals indicate latent preferences,--> and rectangles indicate information--the mechanism of influence in this model.





Public pressure campaigns have no place in this model.  I aim to fill this
gap

<!--  % %  I theorize that activists' opportunities and strategies and latent public opinion drive engagement. -->


<!-- Leaving out Typology for now. 

### Types of Public Engagement

I classify supporters into three types: minimal supporters, passionate supporters, and inspired supporters. The number of each and ratios among them each describe key pieces of
political information. In the context of public
comments, minimal supporters submit comments that are exact copies of a form letter, essentially a petition signature. It is the minimal effort required to participate in a campaign. Commenters that also take time to add their own text to a form letter
indicate more intense preferences. For example, 37,127 commenters mobilized by EarthJustice submitted the same form, but 6,837 of them also added additional personalized comments. Mobilizing organizations often encourage their supporters to write personalized comments and emphasize the number of people who took the time to write personalized comments in their own comments. 
<!--For example, Earthjustice noted the number of people who wrote personalized comments when it uploaded its mass comment campaign. "Attached is the file containing the names of 37,127 individuals who have submitted public comments urging the Environmental Protection Agency to ban organophosphate and carbamate pesticides. In addition to signing on in support of the following letter, 6,837 individuals of the total number have submitted personalized comments." ([EPA-HQ-OPP-2012-0161-0087](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OPP-2012-0161-0087))] ->

Finally, commenters who express
solidarity in similar but distinct phrases indicate they were inspired
indirectly, perhaps by a news story or a social media post about the campaign, as campaign messages spread beyond those initially
targeted.^[Some people in this latter category may engage purely on their own initiative, but any impact they have likely comes from their alignment with a coalition. Furthermore, as I show
    below, wholly original comments are rare.]   The third type indicates
potential contagion. Indications that messages spread beyond those
initially targeted may be especially powerful [@Kollman1998].

    
The size of each group offers political information to
policymakers, including coalition resources, the intensity of sentiment,
and the potential for conflict to spread. The first two types signal two
kinds of intensity or resolve. First, they show the mobilizers'
willingness to commit resources to the issue. Second, costly actions
show the intensity of opinions among the mobilized segment of the public
[@Dunleavy1991]. The number of people engaged by a campaign is not
strictly proportional to an organization's investment. The less people
care, the more it costs to mobilize them.

Thus, public pressure campaigns produce information about organizational resolve, the intensity of public demands, and the potential of the campaign or movement to grow. 
-->

<!--Following the typology developed above, indicators of a successful mobilization campaign include (1) the number
of comments supporting a coalition, (2) the effort per comment, and (3) the number of comments mobilized indirectly.-->

<!--
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:disrupt) would be undermined if lobbying organizations
with less public support are no more likely to engage in outside
lobbying when their opponents do so. 

While @Potter2017 found industry
groups were no more likely to advocate for rules to be strengthened,
weakened or withdrawn, this does not mean that they are not more likely
to mobilize when their opponents do so.
-->

<!--
```{hypothesis, support, echo = TRUE}
Lobbying coalitions
mobilize mass engagement when they perceive the attentive public is on
their side, have sufficient resources, and perceive an opportunity to
influence policy.
```


The key part of Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:support) is that mobilizing is correlated with
existing public support, what might be called "grass-roots" support. 

 It is possible
that the "potentially mobilized" segments of the public are unrelated to
public support before being contacted by the campaign, for example, if
mobilization is driven more by partisan identities than issue
preferences.
-->
<!--If an organization does not perceive a
lobbying opportunity, it would be incorrect to call mobilization a
lobbying strategy. Many factors may contribute to perceived political
opportunities. For example, @Moore2017 finds that agencies that use high
levels of expertise (as defined by @Selin2015) receive fewer comments,
possibly because mobilizing organizations perceive these rules to be
less open to influence.-->





# Policy 

<!--
In a 2020 meeting, Reeve T. Bull, Research Director, Administrative Conference of the United States, summed up the dominant attitude of legal professionals:

> "What are the fundamental goals that the agency and the APA are trying to accomplish by creating this mechanism for public participation?...[W]hen somebody files a comment with an agency, the comments sort of fall into two broad categories...the first type of comment are those expressing fact---providing data to the agency, either supporting the position that it wants to take or opposing the position that it wants to take--and trying to influence the agency's decision making accordingly. 

> The second broad type of [public comments] are those expressing opinions. Now obviously, there's extensive overlap between the two. Pretty much every comment is going to express an opinion one way or the other. But as Steve's data shows, sometimes a comment is nothing but an opinion. It's 'I support this policy' or 'I don't support the policy... the law is very, very clear that with respect to the fact, with respect to data, the agency is legally required to take that into account... With respect to opinion, though, the law is much less clear. Indeed it's not clear whether the agency has to take opinion into account or conversely whether the agency is even permitted to take opinion into account. ...[Agencies] have been very, very consistent in saying the rulemaking process is not a plebiscite. It's not a vote. We're not tabulating the number of comments in favor or against. ...On the part of the public, though, I think the perception is quite a bit different. And I think that people really considered it problematic from their perspective that the agency might take a position that is different from what the vast majority of commenters might have preferred. And with respect to that latter aspect -- the democratic aspect, if you will -- that's where I think a lot of the problems potentially start to arise. 

> I don't think it's ever legitimate in a mass comment campaign for the agency to tabulate the number of comments received and say we got this number of this percentage in favor or against. Even if the comments are 99 percent in one direction or the other, I think that the agency should certainly consider mass comments. They should certainly consider the relevant information -- the facts contained in those comments. But I don't think that the overall number or percentage should never matter." - Reeve T. Bull, Research Director, Administrative Conference of the United States.

"To reach an understanding in a dialogue is not merely a matter of putting oneself forward and successfully asserting one's own point of view, but being transformed into a communion in which we do not remain what we were." (Gadamer)

In the tradition of scholars like Gadamer and Habermas 

"The democratic procedure for the production of law evidently forms the only post-metaphysical source of legitimacy. But what provides this procedure with its
legitimating force? Discourse theory answers this question with a
simple, and at first glance unlikely, answer: democratic procedure
makes it possible for issues and contributions, information and
reasons to float freely" <!--; it secures a discursive character for political
will-formation; and it thereby grounds the fallibilist assumption
that results issuing from the proper procedure are more or less reasonable."

intersubjectivity

discourse both presupposes and creates shared expectations 

My impression was that law and discourse both presuppose and create shared expectations: 

"law simultaneously secures symmetrical relationships of reciprocal recognition between abstract bearers of individual rights. These structural similarities between law and communicative action explain why discourses, and thus reflexive forms of communicative action, play a constitutive role for the production (and application) of legal norms."

(The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/many-comments-critical-of-fiduciary-rule-are-fake-1514370601) reported that 40% of comments on one Department of Labor rule used fraudulent identities.

#### Astroturf 

> TODO
--> 

<!--
A key feature of astroturf lobbying is its covert nature. On December 19, 1995, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, establishing new registration and reporting requirements for lobbyists working for corporations, charities, and other nonprofit organizations engaged in efforts to influence legislative and executive branch decisions. The 1995 act was the first major legislation on lobbying in nearly 50 years and was designed to provide transparency in the lobbying process. Early drafts of the Lobbying Disclosure Act included provisions requiring the registration of firms engaged in astroturf lobbying and the reporting of the expenditures made on those actions. Those provisions, however, failed to make it out of committee. As the bill's sponsor, Senator Carl Levin, testified before a House committee considering the bill: “Every reference to grassroots lobbying—and even to paid efforts to stimulate artificial grassroots lobbying—has been deleted from the bill…I am personally disappointed that we were unable to do anything to address the issue of a form of grassroots lobbying referred to as astroturf lobbying, in which lobbyists hire professional experts to run phone banks and generate mail in support of their efforts. In my view, these paid, professional astroturf campaigns bear nothing in common with the genuine grassroots activities…I…hope that the House will reconsider the disclosure of such lobbying.

Each week, students in my public policy class must write to an elected official or comment on a proposed agency rule and then post about it in the class forum. 
But college students should not be the target demographic for notice and comment rulemaking---they are too informed and tend to have too much time to write thoughtful comments. 
If we wish to realize the ideals of the Administrative Procedure Act, we must broaden participation. Can we do this? -->



<!--
First, we must dispense with the idea that agencies merely implement the law. The Administrative Procedure Act provides for public participation because the ideal of direct democracy might affect the important substantive policy made by agencies. Indeed, agencies are often seeking comment on revisions to rules based on authority delegated decades ago. The present question is one of process. Calling for greater congressional oversight or presidential control sidesteps the issue---by what process should the bureaucracy make policy? <!-- (Indeed, @Potter2019 shows us that agencies often sidestep oversight, making their procedural rules all the more important.)-->

<!--
as others have pointed out 

As the moderator of my class's forum, I can co-sign research on discursive democracy initiatives that realizing transformative discourse is difficult. The ideal of "transformed into something" is laudable, but people are busy, and any barrier to participation will massively reduce participation. Participation already follows a log scale distribution, with most rules receiving no comments--even major rules, on average, receive less than 10. 
-->


<!--
The main barrier to participation in rulemaking is information. Even people with relatively high social capital, like small business owners, rarely participate because they do not know about the opportunity or lack the time necessary to engage. 


> "They might only find out about a proposed regulation when they're presented with one of these mass comments.  And they might not have time to go back and investigate and then write a full comment letter right before the comment period is going to close.  Because there aren't a lot of small business owners who read the Federal Register every day...writing a detailed comment letter is hard work." - Oliver Sherhouse (GSA 2019a, p. 33)

<!--**Increase transparency.**-->


<!--
Social media
    engagement may be especially important if agencies implement the
    recommendations of @ACUS2018 that "Agencies should consider using
    social media before or in connection with direct final rulemaking to
    quickly identify whether there are significant or meaningful
    objections" (p. 34).

#### Increasing transparency and public participation (GSA-2019-02) {-}

On January 30, 2020, the Government Services Administration held a hearing on the topic of mass comments. The three invited speakers represented the National Association of Manufacturers, the Small Business Administration, and MITRE. A federally funded technology research and development firm. These three guests embody important aspects of how public comment is seen. 

First, public comment is most often utilized by business groups like NAM ("power users of the regulatory process," as Hedern put it) and thus represents the users for whom public comment technology is designed. NAM does not sponsor mass comment campaigns. Perhaps they have a stake in delegitimizing mass comment campaigns that occasionally mobilized on the opposing side, but the reason they are on this panel is simply that they are the archetypical user. Second, agencies like the Small Business Administration are the ones who must deal with the "challenge" of mass comment campaigns. Third, technology consultants represent the way in which mass comment campaigns are primarily viewed as a technological challenge.

Another important feature of this policy area is its tight-knit epistemic community. As observed by Mr. Hedren:

> "it's a little alarming to me in some respects to see that, looking out into the crowd, I think I know about half of you on a first-name basis. So, we probably need a little bit more fresh blood in this regulatory nerd community." - Patrick Hedren, National Association of Manufacturers.

-->

<!-- 
> And we've very much kind of what, I would consider power users of the regulatory process. We have a clear point of view for the manufacturing sector.  We infrequently weigh in agency actions across the entire federal family, whether they're independent agencies or executive agencies and departments.  So we have quite a lot of experience and exposure to the tools that really underpin the system.  And there's a lot of value in those tools.-->
