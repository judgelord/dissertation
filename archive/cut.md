rulemaking [@Coglianese2001], but **this intuition has yet to be tested.**-->





<!-- OLD INTRO 
This dissertation explores the role of public pressure campaigns in U.S. federal agency rulemaking, a technocratic policy process where "public participation" is usually limited to sophisticated lobbying but occasionally includes millions of people mobilized by public pressure campaigns. Public comment periods on proposed policies purport to provide democratic accountability. Yet, theories of bureaucratic policymaking largely ignore the occasional bursts of civic engagement that generate the vast majority of public comments on proposed rules. To fill this gap, I build and test theories about the role of public pressure in policymaking. I collect and analyze millions of public comments to develop the first systematic measures of civic engagement and influence in bureaucratic policymaking. -->

Who are these well-resourced groups?  
Do they lobby in other venues (like congressional policymaking)?  
Why should we consider these very select groups and their actions democratizing?  Perhaps they – themselves – are quite elitist?  Take this question head-on.  Maybe digging into the literature on membership groups would help here.  
Are super mobilizers different from others?

TODO: FROM SUSAN: 
-more about very few “policy advocacy organizations” that organize much of the mass commenting activity AND the “ordinary citizens” that are activated to submit a comment.  We need at least 1 or 2 very meaty paragraph(s) with many citations to past literature.  For example, “XXX (2013) used data on ___ to investigate policy advocacy organizations and found that they tend to ____.  In contrast, XXX (1975; see also XX, XX, XX) demonstrate that aren’t typically membership organizations because _____.  In sum, the interest group literature points to ____ as major factors in driving ____(see:  XXX, XXX, and XXX), but we still don’t fully understand how activity by these types of organizations might matter to bureaucracy policymaking, especially rulemaking.”  Put differently, what does the literature tell us about these groups and their lobbying?  This should explain what we currently know.  

These groups seem special, but I don’t know how (other than they are mostly environmental groups).  

Also, there must be policy advocacy organizations that don’t participate in rulemaking.  Why?  I DON'T KNOW!

Do all policy advocacy organizations use mass campaigns sometimes?  NO.

why is this so focused on environmental politics?  DIFFUSE PUBLIC INTERESTS REQUIRES MOBILIZATION.

Is there a threshold effect – groups need to have some funds to organize mass commenting campaigns.  What does that look like?  If that’s the case, then should we really consider them “less-resourced” (see abstract on page 42)?  How are we supposed to understand more or less-resourced (or is this just a proxy for private versus public)? CITE LOBBYING DONATIONS

CUT FROM WHY MOBILIZE FOR NOW

<!--  % %  I theorize that activists' opportunities and strategies and latent public opinion drive engagement. -->


<!-- Leaving out Typology for now. 

### Types of Public Engagement

I classify supporters into three types: minimal supporters, passionate supporters, and inspired supporters. The number of each and ratios among them each describe key pieces of
political information. In the context of public
comments, minimal supporters submit comments that are exact copies of a form letter, essentially a petition signature. It is the minimal effort required to participate in a campaign. Commenters that also take time to add their own text to a form letter
indicate more intense preferences. For example, 37,127 commenters mobilized by EarthJustice submitted the same form, but 6,837 of them also added additional personalized comments. Mobilizing organizations often encourage their supporters to write personalized comments and emphasize the number of people who took the time to write personalized comments in their own comments. 
<!--For example, Earthjustice noted the number of people who wrote personalized comments when it uploaded its mass comment campaign. "Attached is the file containing the names of 37,127 individuals who have submitted public comments urging the Environmental Protection Agency to ban organophosphate and carbamate pesticides. In addition to signing on in support of the following letter, 6,837 individuals of the total number have submitted personalized comments." ([EPA-HQ-OPP-2012-0161-0087](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OPP-2012-0161-0087))] ->

Finally, commenters who express
solidarity in similar but distinct phrases indicate they were inspired
indirectly, perhaps by a news story or a social media post about the campaign, as campaign messages spread beyond those initially
targeted.^[Some people in this latter category may engage purely on their own initiative, but any impact they have likely comes from their alignment with a coalition. Furthermore, as I show
    below, wholly original comments are rare.]   The third type indicates
potential contagion. Indications that messages spread beyond those
initially targeted may be especially powerful [@Kollman1998].

    
The size of each group offers political information to
policymakers, including coalition resources, the intensity of sentiment,
and the potential for conflict to spread. The first two types signal two
kinds of intensity or resolve. First, they show the mobilizers'
willingness to commit resources to the issue. Second, costly actions
show the intensity of opinions among the mobilized segment of the public
[@Dunleavy1991]. The number of people engaged by a campaign is not
strictly proportional to an organization's investment. The less people
care, the more it costs to mobilize them.

Thus, public pressure campaigns produce information about organizational resolve, the intensity of public demands, and the potential of the campaign or movement to grow. 
-->

<!--Following the typology developed above, indicators of a successful mobilization campaign include (1) the number
of comments supporting a coalition, (2) the effort per comment, and (3) the number of comments mobilized indirectly.-->

<!--
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:disrupt) would be undermined if lobbying organizations
with less public support are no more likely to engage in outside
lobbying when their opponents do so. 

While @Potter2017 found industry
groups were no more likely to advocate for rules to be strengthened,
weakened or withdrawn, this does not mean that they are not more likely
to mobilize when their opponents do so.
-->

<!--
```{hypothesis, support, echo = TRUE}
Lobbying coalitions
mobilize mass engagement when they perceive the attentive public is on
their side, have sufficient resources, and perceive an opportunity to
influence policy.
```


The key part of Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:support) is that mobilizing is correlated with
existing public support, what might be called "grass-roots" support. 

 It is possible
that the "potentially mobilized" segments of the public are unrelated to
public support before being contacted by the campaign, for example, if
mobilization is driven more by partisan identities than issue
preferences.
-->
<!--If an organization does not perceive a
lobbying opportunity, it would be incorrect to call mobilization a
lobbying strategy. Many factors may contribute to perceived political
opportunities. For example, @Moore2017 finds that agencies that use high
levels of expertise (as defined by @Selin2015) receive fewer comments,
possibly because mobilizing organizations perceive these rules to be
less open to influence.-->
