As organizations charged with realizing policy goals, government agencies shape policy in important ways. Here I emphasize three. The power to set the default policy, the power to make vague or oudated policy specific, actionable, and relevant, and the power of implimentation. Much of the scholarship on government agencies in the US has focused on their role in implimentation. In part, this tendency likely stems from the normative ideal that legislature legislated and ecectutives exicute. Empirically, the extent to which theses tasks are divided is not so clean. Here, I argue that the division of tasks across branches depends on the capacity to do them. 

To make detailed policy, legislatures need both a great deal of capacity and a sufficiently strong or unified majority to act. Some level of burecratic organzation will almost alwasy be required to impliment legilative mandates. Often a great deal of organization is required. In implimentation there is descrtetion and thus power. Where legislatures lack the capacity to draft nuanced policy or to frequently pass new legislation, the bureaucracies charged with solving problems have even more to do.

When legislatures do not act, policy defaults to that made by bureaucrats. Game theoretic model often specificy the defuault policy as either the status quo [CITE] or the president's ideal policy [CITE]. Both assumptions have truth to them, but a more general statement that captures both intuitiotns is that the defaults are those made or used by the implimentors. Agencies may keep policy stable in the absense of of new legislation, but they often do not. When making (or not making) new policy, agencies often make policy close to the president's ideal point, but not perfectly. More importantly, because the White House and even their apointees generally have less expertise and policymaking capacity than agency officials who actually write agency rules, it is more acurate to say that agency officials make policy, constrainted by Congress and the White House. 

Even when legislatures do act, the specificity and completeness of legislation is limted by their capacity and expertise on the issue. Where congressional capacity and expertise is less than that of agencies, bureaucrats end up writing policy. This may occur in what I call "first-stage" legislating---where agency officials draft policy text that is then adopted by elected legislators [@Carpenter2001]. More often, it occurs when agency officials must write policy to fill details of vague statutes or adapt old statutory authorities to new problems. Law scholars call rules that do more then "impliment" statutes "legislative rules," though the line demark legislative rules from other rules is unclear.  I call this "second-stage" legislating. It occurs in inverse proportion to congressional capacity.

We can imagine alternative distributions of legislative capacity across institutions. For example, if the U.S. Congress were to hire a sufficient number of policy staff to rival the policy expertie and capacity of agencies, legislators would be able to draft statutes as nuanced as rules are today. This greatly increased congressional bureaucracy could draft statutes with much need and less room for interpreting and adapting. Assuming congress is able to act, this capacity would also help statutes change to address emerging issues as agency rules do today. Such a congressional burecucy would surely be lobbied and influenced in ways very similar to the executive-branch bureacusy is today. It could thus be studied in a similar fastion.
