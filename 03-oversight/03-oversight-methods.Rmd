### Modeling the Relationship Between Public Pressure and Congressional Oversight

To assess the hypothesis that public pressure campaigns affect the engagement of
political principals, I examine the relationship between mass commenting
and the behavior of members of Congress.
The bold arrow in figure \@ref(fig:causal-oversight) indicates the key relationship
that I test in this step. I aim to test the relationship between the scale of
public engagement and engagement from members of Congress, who may
receive political information (e.g., about the level of public attention or public opinion) from public pressure campaigns and the resulting mass commenting.

```{r causal-oversight, fig.cap = "The Mediator Model: The Relationship Between Public Pressure and Congressional Oversight"}
#TODO add headers, cut out demands, add political information box, shift principal comments over
#TODO add outcome model
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "causal-oversight-1.png"))
```



I measure the dependent variables---legislator attention and support---in several ways. First, I count the number of times members of Congress
engage in comment
periods on rules where lobbying organizations did and did not go public.
By engaging the agency, I mean that members of Congress raise a rule in
personal correspondence or comments that members send to the agency. I
then code each contact from the member of Congress and each coalition
lobbying on the rule on the same three-point scale: are they asking for
the rule to go further, be scaled back, or published as-is. This is
similar to other hand-coding approaches to policy demands. <!--Next, I use
text analysis to compare the sentiment and rhetoric (phrases and word
frequencies) used by legislators to the language used by each coalition.-->
