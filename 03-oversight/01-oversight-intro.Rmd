### Congressional oversight as a mediator of interest-group influence {#oversight-theory}

When George W. Bush replaced Bill Clinton as president, career
bureaucrats at the Federal Trade Commission knew that this meant a
change in policy priorities. Many rulemaking projects initiated under
the Clinton administration were likely to be withdrawn or put on hold.
They also knew that the new administration wanted to be perceived as
advancing a new policy agenda, not merely undoing Clinton-era
regulations. Entrepreneurs within the agency saw a political window of
opportunity to initiate a new regulatory agenda aimed at curbing a
growing volume of telemarketing calls. This initiative seemed likely to
be popular with voters but, even with a supportive president, would be
difficult to advance over the objections of the telemarketing industry
whose campaign donations had earned them many powerful allies in
Congress. Agency officials report being pessimistic about the FTC's
telemarketing effort succeeding over opposition from Congress.

When the draft "Telemarketing Sales Rule" (also known as the "Do Not
Call" rule) was published, however, public support and engagement were
overwhelming. The rule received thousands of supportive comments from
frustrated members of the public who were encouraged to comment by
advocacy groups like the Consumer Federation of America. Agency
officials report that the volume of public response not only encouraged
the agency and the administration but, more importantly, "scared off"
Members of Congress who the industry was relying on to kill or reverse
the rule (personal communication, 2018). Once it became clear that the public was paying attention and
sufficiently mobilized to act on the issue, elected officials became
much less willing to take unpopular positions supporting industry
donors. Instead, Congress ended up codifying the agency's authority to
implement the Do Not Call regulations with legislation the following
year.

The story of the Do Not Call rule suggests that public engagement in
rulemaking may occasionally be influential because it affects the
behavior of elected officials who have the power to provide key support
or opposition to a proposed rule.

Other examples show that members of Congress know about and may be spurred to act by public pressure campaigns. For example, several members of Congress attached to their comments on CFPB's Payday Loan rule (CFPB-2016-0025) mass mail or petitions from their constituents.

Public pressure campaigns often seek to influence policy by informing them of constituent demands. Many campaigns collect the zip code of letter-signers so that they can forward constituent comments to their representatives. Some form letters include a line for signers to "CC" (carbon copy) their member of Congress (see, for example [EPA-HQ-OAR-2005-0161-2624](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2005-0161-2624)).

Lobbying campaigns can also capture the attention of members of Congress on the opposite side of the issue. For example, in 2016, a group of Democratic legislators wrote encouraging words to Obama's the Treasury Department: "We urge you not to yield to the intense lobbying against these regulations, directed both at Treasury and the Congress, but multinational business and its trade associations."

#### Principal-agent Relationships During Rulemaking


Political oversight of bureaucracies has long concerned both
practitioners and theorists. Political scientists often model the
relationship between elected officials and bureaucrats as a
principal-agent problem. For example, an agency may have a preferred
policy but may change the
rule or delay its publication upon observing its principals' preferences. Agencies may do this to avoid political
consequences such as having their policies reversed [@Potter2016] or
because they perceive elected officials as representing public demands
[@Cuellar2005]. While it is widely accepted that agency officials take
their principals' positions into account, the mechanisms by which
this occurs and the empirical conditions for political control are
debated.

Because I focus on influence in the period between the publication of draft
and final rules, I focus on information about principals' preferences
revealed to the agency in this period. Oversight during rulemaking is a
form of ex-post control [@Epstein1994], in this case, after the proposed
rule is published. Upon learning the content of a draft rule, an official with power over the agency may
choose to signal their demands to the agency. There is an ongoing debate
among scholars over how political oversight operates--i.e., how principals' observable behaviors actually inform agency decisions.

@McCubbins1987 suggest two oversight mechanisms. Principals may
proactively attend to agency activities, like a "police patrol," or they
may rely on bureaucrats' fear of sanction when attentive interest groups
alert principals about agency activities, more like a "fire alarm."
Administrative procedures like mandatory public comment periods thus
offer opportunities for direct oversight and to be alerted to oversight
opportunities [@Balla1998].

### Incorporating Political Information into Models of Political Oversight

In addition to interest groups directly alerting elected officials to
oversight opportunities as in the "fire alarm" model, the political
information signaled by public pressure campaigns may alert elected officials to
political risks (like a "warning sign") *or*, conversely, to encourage
the agency to hold course (like a "beacon") attracting positive attention
and credit claiming opportunities for their oversight work. In the case of the FTC's "Do Not
Call" rule and subsequent legislation, mass engagement functioned more
as a "warning" for would-be opponents and a "beacon" for potential
allies, effectively enabling and empowering rather than restraining the
agency as the classic "fire alarm" concept suggests. Agency officials
credit the public support mobilized by mass comment campaigns with the
political cover needed to hold course.

```

Public pressure campaigns in bureaucratic policymaking may affect the behavior of
an agency's principals because the shadow of public sanction hangs over
elected officials [@Arnold1979; @Mayhew2000]. @Moore2018 finds that
agencies that receive more comments per rule are also subject to more
congressional hearings. When the public is more attentive, it is more
important for officials to take popular positions and avoid unpopular
ones. Thus, when a coalition goes public, especially if it generates a
perceived consensus in expressed public sentiments, elected officials
ought to be more likely to intervene on their behalf and less likely to
intervene against them.

### Hypotheses about the relationship between mass engagement and oversight {#oversight-hypotheses}

It may be the case that both principals and the majority of commenters
hold the same position simply because it is popular. Thus, to assess the
"fire-alarm," "beacon," and "warning sign" mechanisms, it is important
to condition on principals' existing policy positions and to control for
their baseline rates of commenting. I estimate principals' baseline rates
of commenting using legislators' comments on similar rules that did not
receive a mass comment campaign. <!-- I may also use partisanship to
approximate principals' priors. Future work could improve this by coding
principals' specific policy positions using the best data available
before the draft rule's publication.-->

**Hypothesis 2:** *Elected officials' advocacy is moderated by mass
engagement.*

**Hypothesis 3:** Mass commenting attract
oversight from allies. The more comments supporting a position, the more
likely principals holding that position are to engage.

**Hypothesis 4:** Mass commenting
reduces oversight from opponents. The more comments opposing a position,
the less likely principals holding that position are to engage.

Hypothesis 3 implies that $\beta_1$ is positive and
Hypothesis 4 $\beta_2$ is negative in this statement:
*Pr(Principal Comments $|$ Principal Position $i$)
$\sim \beta_0 + \beta_1$Comments supporting $i + \beta_2$Comments
opposing $i$*

If Hypothesis 3 is correct, it would suggest an addendum to Hall
and Miler's (2008) finding that legislators are more likely to engage in
rulemaking when they have been lobbied by a like-minded interest group:
When interest groups lobby elected officials to engage in rulemaking,
they may be more likely to engage when aligned with the majority of
commenters than when opposed to them. If elected officials learn from
political information, they will be even more likely to engage when
lobbied by a coalition that includes public interest groups running a
mass-comment campaign, and less likely to engage when opposed by a large
mass comment campaign.^[Of course, if Members of Congress receive signals about the
    distribution of comments from their districts, the distribution of
    opinions in their district constituency may be more important.
    Figure \@ref(fig:sierra), shows that the Sierra Club requires zip
    code information from commenters. Mass-mobilizers may often send
    such information to elected officials.]

Alternatively, the effect of mass engagement on political principals may
be asymmetric. Mass engagement may only mobilize or only demobilize. For
example elected officials may be attracted to oversight opportunities
but not dissuaded by mobilization on the other side because they assume
their voters share their position. Or, if elected officials are risk
adverse, they may avoid engaging in contentious rulemaking processes
regardless of the balance of comments. Each of these results would be
evidence against hypothesis
3 or
4 respectively.

I thus build on the classic model of
political oversight in two ways. First, I suggest that elected officials' comments are a particularly relevant oversight behavior and a
mechanism by which bureaucrats learn and update beliefs about their
principals' demands. Second, I suggest that such oversight behaviors
may be affected by public pressure because of the impressions of public
opinion (i.e., the political information) it creates.
