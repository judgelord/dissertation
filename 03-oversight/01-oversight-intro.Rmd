### Congressional Oversight as a Mediator of Interest-group Influence {#oversight-theory}

When George W. Bush replaced Bill Clinton as president, career
bureaucrats at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) knew that this meant a
change in policy priorities. Many rulemaking projects initiated under
the Clinton administration were likely to be withdrawn or put on hold.
They also knew that the new administration wanted to be perceived as
advancing a new policy agenda, not merely reversing Clinton-era
policies. Policy entrepreneurs within the agency saw a political window of
opportunity to initiate a new regulatory agenda to curb a
growing volume of telemarketing calls. This initiative seemed likely to
be popular with voters but, even with a supportive president, would be
difficult to advance over the objections of the telemarketing industry,
whose campaign donations had earned them many powerful allies in
Congress. Agency officials report being pessimistic about the FTC's
telemarketing effort overcoming opposition from Congress.

When the draft "Telemarketing Sales Rule" (also known as the "Do Not
Call" rule) was published, however, public support and engagement were
overwhelming. The rule received thousands of supportive comments from
frustrated members of the public who were encouraged to comment by
advocacy groups like the Consumer Federation of America. Agency
officials reported that the volume of public response not only encouraged
the agency and the administration but, more importantly, "scared off" members of Congress who the industry was relying on to kill or reverse
the rule (personal communication, 2018). Once it became clear that the public was paying attention and
sufficiently mobilized to act on the issue, elected officials became
much less willing to take unpopular positions to support industry
donors. Instead, Congress ended up codifying the agency's authority to
implement the Do Not Call regulations with legislation the following
year.

The story of the Do Not Call rule suggests that public engagement in
rulemaking may occasionally be influential because it affects the
behavior of elected officials who have the power to provide key support
or opposition to a proposed rule. Public attention and support gave agency officials the "political cover" (personal communication, 2018) to advance their policy agenda. Public pressure campaigns demobilized political opposition, changing the agency's political environment and policy outcomes.

James Q. Wilson notes a similar pattern with the FTC's Funeral Industry Practice Rule and Used Car Rule:

> "Undertakers and used-car dealers were outraged by these proposed rules. Very quickly, members of Congress discovered just how many undertakers and car dealers they had in their districts and how well-connected they were. The FTC suddenly had activated large, hostile interests who were successful in getting Congress to force the agency to back down." [@Wilson1989, pg. 83]

Members of Congress often learn about and are often spurred to act by public pressure campaigns. Legislators often submit comments from their constituents, either on their own or attached to their own comments. For example, several members of Congress attached to their comments on CFPB's Payday Loan rule (CFPB-2016-0025) mass mail or petitions from their constituents. 

Public pressure campaigns often seek to influence policy by informing elected officials of their constituents' demands. Many campaigns collect the zip code of letter-signers so that they can forward constituent comments to their representatives. Some form letters include a line for signers to "CC" (carbon copy) their member of Congress (see, for example [EPA-HQ-OAR-2005-0161-2624](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2005-0161-2624)).

Congressional attention is not just "fire alarm" oversight. Like interest groups, the comments of members of Congeress often support proposed rules.
For example, in 2016, a group of Democratic legislators wrote encouraging words to Obama's Treasury Department: "We urge you not to yield to the intense lobbying against these regulations, directed both at Treasury and the Congress, but multinational business and its trade associations."

Lobbying campaigns increase the salience of the rulemakings they target. In addition to attracting allies in Congress, increased public attention may capture the attention of members of Congress on the opposite side of the issue. For example, when the Department of the Treasury published draft rules implementing the Unlawful Internet Gambling Act of 2006, the proposal generated unusually high levels of public attention. As a result, two bipartisan groups of legislators submitted comments on the rule. One, led by the chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, raised concerns about the Department's implementation of the Administrative Procedures Act. The other group of legislators, led by Senator Mike Pence, pushed back against interest-group opposition to the rule and urged the Department to implement the rules. 
In short, public pressure campaigns may increase increase the likelihood that legislatures on both sides of the issue engage. 

#### Principal-agent Relationships During Rulemaking

Political oversight of bureaucracies has long concerned both
practitioners and theorists. Political scientists often model the
relationship between elected officials and bureaucrats as a
principal-agent problem. For example, an agency may have a preferred
policy but may change the
rule or delay its publication upon observing its principals' preferences. Agencies may do this to avoid political
consequences such as having their policies reversed [@Potter2016] or
because they perceive elected officials as representing public demands
[@Cuellar2005]. 

While it is widely accepted that agency officials take
their principals' positions into account, the mechanisms by which
this occurs, and the empirical conditions for political influence are
debated. Agencies may be more influenced by unified congressional opposition or support [@Golden2000]. <!-- TODO include divided government in model-->

<!--negotiate or avoid accountability to various principals [@Nou2016; @Potter2016; @Woods2018; @Yackee2009RegGov @Potter2014dis develops a signaling model where agencies propose and principals veto rules depending, in part, on their beliefs about interest group preferences. 
-->

I focus on lobbying influence in the period between the publication of draft and final rules and thus on information about principals' preferences
revealed to the agency in this period. In principal-agent terms, this means I am focusing on "agency policy-making" where the agency makes the first move and members of Congress react, perhaps threatening future sanctions (@Ferejohn1990). Oversight during rulemaking is a
form of ex-post control [@Epstein1994], in this case, after the proposed
rule is published. Upon learning the content of a draft rule, an official with power over the agency may
choose to signal their demands to the agency. 
Elected officials may also engage in procedural oversight, but these procedural demands almost always accompany substantive policy demands [@Lowande2021].

There is an ongoing debate
among scholars over how political oversight operates--i.e., how the behaviors of elected officials inform agency decisions.
@McCubbins1987 suggest two oversight mechanisms. Principals may
proactively attend to agency activities, like a "police patrol," or they
may rely on bureaucrats' fear of sanction when attentive interest groups
alert principals about agency activities, like a "fire alarm."
Administrative procedures like mandatory public comment periods thus
offer opportunities for both proactive oversight and to be alerted to oversight
opportunities [@Balla1998].

### Incorporating Political Information into Models of Political Oversight

In addition to interest groups directly alerting elected officials to
oversight opportunities as in the "fire alarm" model, the political
information signaled by public pressure campaigns may alert elected officials to
political risks (like a "warning sign") *or*, conversely, to encourage
the agency to hold course (like a "beacon") attracting positive attention
and credit claiming opportunities for their oversight work. In the case of the FTC's "Do Not Call" rule and subsequent legislation, mass engagement functioned more as a "warning" for would-be opponents and a "beacon" for potential allies, effectively enabling and empowering rather than restraining the agency as the classic "police patrol" and "fire alarm" concept suggests. <!--Agency officials
credit the public support mobilized by public pressure campaigns with the political cover needed to hold course.-->

The fire alarm, beacon, and warning sight mechanisms have a common thread; political oversight is affected by interest group's public pressure campaigns. To the extent that this is strategic, pressure campaigns aim to influence policy indirectly by affecting the behavior of elected officials.

Figure \@ref(fig:causal-oversight) incorporates these insights to the model set out in \@ref(fig:causal-whymail2). Specifically, it considers how elected officials' decisions to engage in agency rulemaking are affected by political information created by public pressure campaigns *and* create new, additional political information. 
Figure \@ref(fig:causal-oversight) shows two pathways by which lobbying organizations may cause elected officials to contact agency officials. The upper pathway represents the classic "fire alarm" role that interest groups may play in altering elected officials to oversight opportunities. It also captures the related dynamic where interest groups alert elected officials to opportunities to support agency actions. 

<!-- move to influence eventually -->
The lower causal pathway represents the additional role that I suggest interest groups play in political oversight by generating political information through public pressure campaigns.
When lobbying organizations use a public pressure strategy, the political information they create (e.g., about the scale and intensity of public support) may affect agency policymakers directly, as shown in \@ref(fig:causal-whymail2). Additionally, levels of public support may also affect policy indirectly if it affects the behavior of an agency's political principles. When political principals contact agency officials, they create at least two additional kinds of political information. First, they express their opinion on what they think the agency should do, which may have normative power for bureaucrats. Second, principles signal political consequences that agencies may want to avoid [@Potter2017]. Both types of information may persuade agency officials to revise policy documents to address their principals' comments.

```

Public pressure campaigns in bureaucratic policymaking may affect the behavior of
an agency's principals because the shadow of public sanction hangs over
elected officials [@Arnold1979; @Mayhew2000]. @Moore2018 finds that
agencies that receive more comments per rule are also subject to more
congressional hearings. When the public is more attentive, it is more
important for officials to take popular positions and avoid unpopular
ones. Thus, when a coalition goes public, especially if it generates a
perceived consensus in expressed public sentiments, elected officials
may be more likely to intervene on their behalf and less likely to
intervene against them. Hypotheses \@ref(hyp:beacon) and \@ref(hyp:warning) reflect these intuitions.

### Hypotheses about the relationship between mass engagement and oversight {#oversight-hypotheses}

<!--
It may be the case that both principals and most commenters
hold the same position simply because it is popular. Thus, to assess the
"fire-alarm," "beacon," and "warning sign" mechanisms, it is important
to condition on principals' existing policy positions.  
<!-- TODO 
It is also important to control for
their baseline rates of commenting. I estimate principals' baseline rates
of commenting using legislators' comments on similar rules that did not
receive a mass comment campaign. I may also use partisanship to
approximate principals' priors. Future work could improve this by coding
principals' specific policy positions using the best data available
before the draft rule's publication.
-->

```{hypothesis oversight, echo = TRUE}
The scale of public engagement moderates elected officials' engagement in agency rulemaking
engagement.
```

If Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:oversight) is correct, we should observe more members of Congress engaging in policy processes with larger public pressure campaigns. This hypothesis is difficult to test because legislators being mobilized directly by interest groups is often observationally equivalent to legislators being mobilized indirectly due to the response to a public pressure campaign. Above, I offer anecdotal evidence that legislators are aware of and pressure campaigns and see comments from their constituents as important. Still, evidence of correlation is not strong evidence of a causal effect. If, however, we can reject Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:oversight), this is strong evidence that rulemaking comments from members of Congress are not affected by the scale of public attention.  

```{hypothesis beacon, echo = TRUE}
Public pressure campaigns attract
oversight from allies. The more comments supporting a position, the more
likely principals holding that position are to engage.
```



```{hypothesis warning, echo = TRUE}
Public pressure campaigns
reduce oversight from opponents. The more comments opposing a position,
the less likely principals holding that position are to engage.
```



If Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:beacon) is correct, it would suggest a supplement to Hall
and Miler's [-@Hall2008] finding that legislators are more likely to engage in
rulemaking when a like-minded interest group has lobbied them:
When interest groups lobby elected officials to engage in rulemaking,
they may also be more likely to engage when aligned with the majority of
commenters than when opposed to them. If elected officials learn from
political information, they will be even more likely to engage when
lobbied by a coalition that includes public interest groups running a mass-comment campaign, and less likely to engage when opposed by a large
mass comment campaign.^[Of course, if Members of Congress receive signals about the
    distribution of comments from their districts, the distribution of
    opinions in their district constituency may be more important.
    Figure \@ref(fig:sierra) shows that the Sierra Club requires a zip
    code information from commenters. Mass-mobilizers may often send
    such information to elected officials.]

Alternatively, the effect of mass engagement on legislators may
be asymmetric. Mass engagement may only mobilize or only demobilize. For
example, if legislators are risk-averse, they may avoid engaging in contentious rulemaking processes
regardless of the balance of comments. Or, elected officials may be attracted to oversight opportunities
but not dissuaded by mobilization on the other side because they assume
their voters share their position. These results would be
evidence against Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:beacon) and
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:warning), respectively.

I thus build on the classic model of
political oversight in two ways. First, I suggest that such oversight behaviors
maybe affected by public pressure campaigns because of the impressions of public
opinion (i.e., the political information) they create. This is represented by the arrow between "Organization generates political information" and "Political principals contact agency officials" in Figure \@ref(fig:causal-oversight). 

Second, I suggest that elected officials' comments during rulemaking are a particularly relevant oversight behavior and a
mechanism by which bureaucrats learn and update beliefs about their
principals' demands. This is represented by the arrow between "Political principals contact agency officials" and "Agency officials revise policy" in Figure \@ref(fig:causal-oversight). The mechanism is labeled "Information persuades agency officials," which includes information about principal opinions and perceived political consequences.
