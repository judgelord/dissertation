# Conclusion {#book-conclusion}

Most civic participation in bureaucratic policymaking results from pressure campaings.

These campaigns are sponsored by public interest groups. Public interest groups more often have incentives to expand the scope of conflict and occasionally do. However, mobilizing is also  is a tactic that requires resources, leading the vast majority of mobilizing to be led by a few advocacy organizations. A small set of national advocacy organizations mobilize other organizations (as as previously found by @Nelson2012, @English2019, @Dwidar2021 and others). These same advocacy organzations mobilize almost all public participation.

The scale of public attention and pressure campaings in particular are highly correlated with involvment from members of Congress, and coalitions with more members of Congress are more likely to win. However it is difficult to assess the main relationship between public pressure and lobbying success because the policies that groups target are correlated with their likelihood of success. My theory of why groups mobilze set out in Chapter \@ref(whymail) predicts that private interest groups are more likely to mobilize public pressure only when it will help their cause. And indeed, the results presented in \@ref(influence-results) show that pressure campaigns sponsored private interest groups are more highly correlated with lobbying success.

Chapter \@ref(ej) suggests that both pressure campaigns and minority activism can affect the discourse of policymaking, including the preambles to policy documents where agencies justify their approach. When commenters raise distributive justice concerns, agencies are much more likely to address these concerns. The more people who raise such concern, the more likely it is that agencies address them. The overall level of public attention can also substitute for raising specific concerns. Agency are more likely to add a discussion of how policies address environmental justice when large numbers they recieve large numbers of comments. This may be related to the fact that courts are more likely to uphold policies with high levels of participation [@judgelord2016MPSA].


<!--% CONCLUSION
%This research will add to our understanding of how  bureaucratic policymaking fits with the practice of democracy.
%-->
The legitimacy of bureaucratic policymaking is said to depend on the premise that rulemaking provides for public voice [@Croley2003, @Rosenbloom2003]. Yet, to date, we have had a weak an empirical base necessary to evaluate whether any legitimacy the public comment process may provide is deserved. If input solicited from ordinary people has little effect on policy outcomes, directly or indirectly, it may be best understood as providing a veneer of democratic legitimacy on an essentially technocratic and/or elite-driven process. This dissertation has made serveral important steps toward better understanding public engagement in bureaucratic policymaking.
