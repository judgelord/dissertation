The opportunity to spend years writing a dissertation is a rare gift that grows out of many other gifts. 
Anne Judge and Bob Lord tirelessly to give me my roots and every opportunity. 
Kristina Fullerton Rico is the best partner in the world. Every day she makes me a smarter and better person. 

My committee, Susan Webb Yackee, Eleanor Powell, Alexander Tahk, David Weimer, and Miriam Seifter were extremely generous with their time and wisdom. The best parts of this dissertation are responses to their deft questions.

I am in debt to participants in
the American Politics Workshop at UW-Madison, especially Michael DeCrescenzo, Daniel Walters, and Marcy Sheih;
the 2020 American Political Economy Workshop, especially Alex Hertel-Fernandez;
the 2020 APSA Dissertation Workshop participants: Daniel Mallinson, Darrell Lovell, Sam Zuhlke, Elizabeth Dorssom, Nathalie Mendez, Isaac Pollert, Mark Bento;
the 2019 Southern Political Science Conference, especially Brian Libgober;
the 2018 Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences Conference;
and many others who took time to talk through ideas and solve problems, including
Ben Cashore,
Barry Burden, 
Scott Straus,
David Canon,

Michael Promisel,
Ben Power,

There are too many contributors to R packages and Stack Exchange to name, but 
Michael DeCrescenzo (again) deserves special thanks as a provider of public goods, including the better parts of this document's styling.

Emma Horton, John Hoffman, and Karolina Rico graciously hosted an exceptionally dull houseguest and supplied needed fun and good food.

The analysis in Chapter 3 is only possible due to the hard work of a top-notch team of research assistants: Samiha Bhushan, Julia Derzay, Megan Gmelich, Hope Karnopp, Max Linse,  Lucy McNeil, Jackson Mozena, Anastasie Ndahayo,  Maggie Claire Nead, and Hailey Patel
