The opportunity to spend years writing a dissertation is a rare gift that grows out of many other gifts. 
Anne Judge and Bob Lord worked tirelessly to give me strong roots and every opportunity to grow. 
Kristina Fullerton Rico is the best partner in the world. Every day she makes me a smarter and better person. 

My committee, Susan Webb Yackee, Eleanor Powell, Alexander Tahk, David Weimer, and Miriam Seifter were extremely generous with their time and wisdom. The best parts of this dissertation are responses to their astute questions.

There are too many contributors to R packages and Stack Exchange to name, but 
Michael DeCrescenzo (again) deserves special thanks as a provider of public goods, including the better parts of this document's styling.

Mil, mil gracias to Karolina Rico who opened her home and let me take over her office during the beginning of the pandemic.
Emma Horton and John Hoffman graciously hosted an exceptionally dull houseguest and supplied me with good food while I wrote and much-needed fun when I was not writing.
