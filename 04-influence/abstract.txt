I ask whether public pressure campaigns increase lobbying success in agency rulemaking using a mix of hand-coding and computational text analysis methods. To measure lobbying success, I develop computational methods to identify lobbying coalitions and <!--estimate lobbying success for all rules posted for comment on regulations.gov. and--> hand-code a random sample of rules for whether each coalition got the policy outcome they sought. I then assess potential mechanisms by which mass public engagement may affect policy. Each mechanism involves a distinct type of information revealed to decisionmakers. Of primary interest is the extent to which public pressure campaigns affect agency decisionmakers directly or indirectly through their effects on elected officials' oversight behaviors. 
I find that members of Congress are more likely to engage in rulemaking when advocacy groups mobilize public pressure. 
However, I find little evidence that public pressure campaigns increase lobbying success. Lobbying coalitions are more successful when they mobilize more members of Congress, but legislators disproportionatly align with private interest (e.g., busisness-led) coalitions, not the public interest coalitions that run most public pressure campaigns.
