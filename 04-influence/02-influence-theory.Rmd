<!--Observers often ask how effective public pressure campaigns are. From a political science perspective, the question is 
Increasing civic engagement, oversight, and information,-->

Scholars of bureaucratic policymaking have focused either on
the sophisticated lobbying efforts of powerful interest groups such as
business coalitions or principal-agent dynamics, especially with respect to Congress. This section first discusses the "classic model" of interest group influence and then amends it to incorporate public pressure campaigns. I then do the same with a simple principal-agent model. The result is one model of interest group influence that includes interactions among sophisticated lobbying strategies, political principals, and public pressure campaigns.

The first model focuses on interest group lobbying. A key insight from scholarship on interest group lobbying in bureaucratic policymaking is that
technical information is the currency of insider lobbying. Figure
\@ref(fig:causal-classic2) illustrates the classic causal
model of insider lobbying that describes most rulemakings and nearly all
scholarship on lobbying in bureaucratic policymaking to date. Diamonds indicate observable choices, ovals indicate latent preferences, and rectangles indicate information--the mechanism of influence in this model.

The first broadly observable step in the rulemaking process is usually the publication of a draft rule in the Federal Register.
While organized groups certainly shape the content of draft policies [@Harter 1982; @Chubb1983; @West2004], the public portion of the policy process begins when the draft is officially published. As the agency finalizes a proposed rule, organized groups' latent policy preferences take the form of concrete demands for changes to the draft policy document. These demands lead to a lobbying strategy that research may, in theory, observe. The provision of technical information is the mechanism of policy influence on which scholars have thus far focused. There are many reasons to believe that this is a powerful, likely the primary way that organized groups can affect policymaking, especially in the bureaucracy. Finally, we observe the resulting policy. Inferences about the extent to which lobbying caused any changes (or lack of changes) between the draft and final rule are challenging, but studies of policy generally use observational data and thus require some assumptions linking policy success (a lobbying group getting their desired result) and policy influence (causing a policy outcome). Groups invest in providing information "relevant" to technocratic policymakers, and the policy response is assumed to be a function of this information.


Public pressure campaigns have no place in this model.  I aim to fill this
gap.

### Public Support: a Political Resource

Skepticism about bureaucratic policymaking as a venue for collective action has led most scholars to dismiss public pressure campaigns as epiphenomenal to bargaining among agency officials, their political principals, and interest groups. Indeed, almost all empirical studies of rulemaking
discard unsophisticated comments from ordinary people. A
comprehensive review of scholarship on The Politics of Rulemaking [
@Yackee2019]  finds skepticism about the influence of citizen comments, but no studies
analyzing public pressure campaigns as a lobbying tactic:

> "@Kerwin2011 point out that a citizen must know not only that a regulation is being formulated but also how and when to participate. This is a high bar for most Americans. Second, to be influential during rulemaking, commenters may require resources and technical expertise. As @Epstein2014 suggest, agency rule-writers---who are often chosen because of their technical or policy-specific expertise---privilege the type of data-driven arguments and reasoning
that are not common to citizen comments." (p. 10)

For any particular lay commenter, this conclusion seems inescapable; individuals acting alone are unlikely to affect policy.
While "ordinary" members of the public may occasionally provide novel
and useful technical information to expert bureaucrats, such
sophisticated means of influencing policy are out of reach for the vast
majority of people. Thus, to investigate the potential role of ordinary
people in bureaucratic politics I look elsewhere---not because ordinary
people never provide novel and useful technical information, but because
this is not how most people attempt to influence policy, nor, I argue,
how we should expect ordinary people to have influence.

Most public comments do not provide useful technical information or
suggest specific edits to policy texts like the interest group comments
that have thus far captured the attention of political scientists. If
they add information to rulemaking, it is a different, more political
flavor of information. Thus, I investigate the value of ordinary people's comments not individually, but as a result of public pressure campaigns.

Two published studies have looked at the relationship between public pressure campaigns and policy outcomes in agency rulemaking. @Shapiro2008b investigates whether the number of public comments relates to the time between draft and final rule. With only nine observations, this study was unable to uncover general patterns. @Balla2020 study 22 Environmental Protection Agency Rules and identify 1,049 "campaigns" on these rules--here a "campaign" means a batch of form letter comments associated with organization, which they code as "regulated" (e.g. a power plant)  or a "regulatory beneficiary" (e.g. environmental groups). They find that the agency was more likely to reference the more sophisticated comments that groups submit than form letters. They also find that several types of observed policy changes (e.g. changes in the number of regulated entities and date the rule goes into effect) better align with changes requested by sophisticated interest group comments than those found in form letters. They conclude:

 > These patterns suggest that legal imperatives trump political considerations in conditioning agency responsiveness, given that mass comment campaigns – relative to other comments – generally contain little “relevant matter.”

While @Balla2002 recognize the political nature of public pressure campaign, they follow many of the administrative law scholars in comparing form letters to sophisticated technical comments. For example, their model compares the number of times the agency references the lengthy comments drafted by the Sierra Club's Legal Team to the number of times the agency references the short form letters drafted by the Sierra Club's Digital Team. In contrast, I argue that we should understand the form letters as a tactic aimed at gaining power for coalitions and organizations that also submit sophisticated technical comments. Public pressure is not an alternative to sophisticated lobbying efforts, it is a resource.

An organization's ability to expand the scope of conflict by mobilizing
a large number of people can be a valuable political resource [@Schattschneider1975]. 
Public engagement and mobilization can be a
tactic to gain power. Scholars who understand mobilization
as a lobbying tactic [@Furlong1997; @Kerwin2011] have focused on how
organizations mobilize their membership. I expand on this understanding of mobilization as a lobbying tactic to include the mobilizing of broader audiences--the "attentive public" [@Key1961] or "issue public" [@Converse1964].

Here I build on three insights. First, @Furlong1997 and @Kerwin2011
identify mobilization as a tactic. The organizations that they surveyed
reported that forming coalitions and mobilizing large numbers of people
are among the most effective lobbying tactics. 

<!-- attribute of coalitions -->
Second, as a tactic, public pressure campaigns generate political support and information about the coalition that mobilized it. @Nelson2012
identify political information as a potentially influential result of
lobbying by different business coalitions. While they focus on
mobilizing experts, I argue that @Nelson2012 describe a dynamic that can be extended
to mass commenting:

> "strategic recruitment, we theorize, mobilizes new actors to
> participate in the policymaking process, bringing with them novel
> technical and political information. In other words, when an expanded

Concerning political information, this logic extends to
non-experts. The number and distribution of ordinary supporters may
matter because it suggests a *public* consensus. Instead of bolstering
*scientific* claims, a perceived public consensus bolsters *political*
claims. 

<!-- direct and indirect influence-->
Third, @Furlong1998, @Yackee2006JPART, and others distinguish
between *direct* and *indirect* forms of interest-group influence in
rulemaking. This distinction is especially important for political
information, which may be most influential through indirect channels,
such as through elected officials. In short, to understand how groups
lobby in rulemaking, we must understand mass mobilization as a tactic
aimed at producing political information that may have direct and
indirect impacts on policymaking.

The direct path to influence involves persuading agency officials. While most scholars have emphasized mass comments' lack of useful
technical information, a few have raised their role in creating
political information. @Cuellar2005 calls on agency officials to pay more
attention to ordinary peoples' expressions of preference and @Rauch2016
suggests reforms to the public comment process to include
opinion polls. I build from a similar intuition that mass comment
campaigns currently function like a poll or
petition, capturing the intensity of preferences among the attentive
public---i.e., how many people are willing to take the time to
engage.^[For example, a campaign by the World Wildlife Federation provided language explicitly claiming to have public opinion on their side.
    Their model comment stated,"Along with 80% of the American
    people, I strongly support ending commercial trade in elephant ivory
    in the US." This suggests that mass comment campaigns aim to signal
    information about public opinion.] Self-selection may not be ideal for representation, but
opt-in participation---whether voting, attending a hearing, or writing a
comment---may often be one of the few heuristics decisionmakers have
about public preferences.

<!--Mobilizing citizens and generating new political information are key
functions of interest groups in a democracy
[@Mansbridge1992; @Mahoney2007]. -->

The indirect pathway involves engaging elected officials, who then influence agency's policy responses. Campaigns inform agency officials about the
distribution and intensity of opinions that are often too nuanced to
estimate a priori. Many questions that arise in rulemaking lack
analogous public opinion polling questions, making mass commenting a
unique source of political information. As with public opinion on any
specific policy issue, most members of the public and their elected
representatives may only learn about the issue and take a position as a
result of a public pressure campaign [@Hutchings2003]. <!--I thus consider
public demands to be a latent factor in my model of policymaking (Figure
\@ref(fig:causal-whymail2). Public demands shape the decisions of
groups who lobby in rulemaking.---> If a lobbying strategist believes the attentive public is
on their side, they may attempt to reveal this political information
to policymakers by launching a public pressure campaign.

```

Figure \@ref(fig:causal-whymail2) amends the "Classic Model" of interest
group lobbying (Figure \@ref(fig:causal-classic2)) to incorporate political information about the attentive public. In addition to providing technical information through sophisticated comments, an organization or coalition of organizations may provide political information by mobilizing supporters.
<!--The more latent public support a group has, the more successful this mobilization effort will be.-->
Large-scale public engagement may produce several types of relevant political
information. For simplicity, \@ref(fig:causal-whymail2) focuses on the most direct and obvious is the expressed "public
opinion" that policymakers observe. I address other types of political information that mass engagement may create below (see Figures \@ref(fig:causal-oversight) and
    \@ref(fig:causal-full)).

<!--
Needs more theorizing and literature development on the direct lobbying link.  This must be informed by a greater breadth of literature (and must go beyond Libgober).  I found the quasi-formalization unhelpful and would have preferred that you spend more time developing why mass commenting campaigns may matter AND tying this to the leader organizations and group mediated participation.  We need theory here, which builds on literature.
i.	In doing so, perhaps explain more the idea of political information and why it creates a direct lobbying link for mass commenters
ii.	Need to discuss Jewell and Bero (JPART) somewhere.

•	Is it REALLY mass commenters who hold the influence here when you do not measure the content of their comments but instead the commenter provided by the leader (which might be much longer, technical, and more sophisticated than the mass comments)? 
i.	Spend more time justifying why, on page 58, we should use the much longer substantive comments to represent the mass mobilization effort? 
•	How do regulators view these mass comments?  Are they only concerned with the longer leader comment (and the mass comments say how much they should really “care” about the leader’s comments)?  Then, is this really democratizing?
-->

The causal process visualized in Figure
\@ref(fig:causal-whymail2) may only operate under certain conditions. 
The influence of political information on policy (the arrow between "Political Information" and "Policy Response") depends on the institutional processes by which agency officials receive and interpret information. We may expect to observe mass mobilization influencing a particular policy only if the mobilization effort was aimed at influencing that policy, rather than using the public comment period to build organizational membership or power more generally (see @CarpenterPetitions).

#### Mass comment campaigns

Understanding civic participation in rulemaking as a mediated process aimed at generating political information posits a different role for mass comment campaigns than that posited by existing (albeit limited) literature on this topic.


<!--

> TODO Critique of Balla et al.

Agencies respond to political information campaigns in different ways.

Political
information will only influence decisions if these signals are processed
in a way that captures this information and relays it to decisionmakers.
These organizational processes may vary significantly across agencies.-->



### Incorporating Political Information into Formal Models of Rulemaking {#formal}


<!--For example, a key assumption of Libgober's (2018) model is that
    bureaucrats have a distribution of preferences over interest group
    positions, about which they are uncertain unless groups reveal their
    preferences through commenting.
