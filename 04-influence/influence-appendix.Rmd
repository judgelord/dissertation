# Data

Replication data are available in SQL and Rdata at
<https://github.com/judgelord/rulemaking>

```{r data}
load(here::here("data", "rules_metadata.Rdata"))

# alternatively 
#rules <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM rules")

#FIXME REPLACE WITH date 
d <- rules %>% mutate(year = str_sub(posted_date, 1,4) %>% as.numeric()) %>%
  filter(year > 2004, year < 2021, document_type %in% c("Proposed Rule", "Rule"))

load(here::here("data", "comments_min.Rdata"))
```

These data currently include `r unique(rules$docket_id) %>% length()`
dockets,
`r rules %>% filter(docket_type == "Rulemaking") %>% distinct(docket_id) %>% nrow()`
rulemaking dockets from `r min(rules$posted_date, na.rm = T) %>% str_remove(",")` to
`r max(rules$posted_date, na.rm = T) %>% str_remove(",")`. These dockets received
approximately `r sum(rules$number_of_comments_received, na.rm = T)`
comments.

This analysis relies of rulemaking dockets from 2005 through 2020. These 
`r d %>% filter(docket_type == "Rulemaking") %>% distinct(docket_id) %>% nrow()`
rulemaking dockets received
`r d %>% filter(docket_type == "Rulemaking") %>% pull(number_of_comments_received) %>% sum(na.rm = T)`
comments.

## Comments from legislators

```{r congress, fig.cap = "Number of Letters from Members of Congress Received During Rulemaking per Year", out.width = "100%", fig.height=6}

         Year %>% as.numeric() < 2021) %>% 
  add_count(agency, name = "agency_n") %>%
  filter(agency_n > 88) %>% 
  count(Year, Chamber, agency, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Year, y = n, fill = Chamber) + 
  geom_col(position = "stack") +

```

## Hand-coded sample

My approach of identifying the dimensions of the conflict by comments has benefits and downsides. Compared to other potentail measures of success, it is more likely to focus on things that commenters care about. For example, one could measure success by the number of times a comment is mentioned in the agency's response to comments. However, this may capture stratigic responsiveness by agencies choosing to discuss some issues more than others. It also counts explicit rejections toward the measure of responsiveness. One could also measure success by focusing on a-priory potential aspects of the policy. @Balla2020 count five factors: (1) the number of regulated entities, (2) number of activities or substances being regulated, (3) the level of pollution standards, (4) the compliance and effective deadlines of the regulation, and (5) the monitoring and reporting requirements. Each takes one value (increasing or decreasing) and each is weighted equally in the analysis. In contrast, starting with comments allows commenters to highlight the issues they care most about.

## Machine-coded Data

> IN PROGRESS

**Dependent variable:** *The percent change in policy text*...

**Explanatory variables:** The *total number of comments*...

# Descriptives

```{hypothesis, meditated, echo = TRUE}
Most people engage in national policy processes as a result of organized public pressure campaigns.
```

```{hypothesis, coalitions, echo = TRUE}
Public pressure campaigns are organized by *coalitions* that include groups that engage in sophisticated technical lobbying.
```

Nearly all mass comments in the hand-coded rules were mobilized by a group that also engaged in sophisticated lobbying.

Organizations (if any) affilitated with different types of comments in the hand-coded data:

```{r}
comments_coded %>% 
  group_by(docket_id, coalition, coalition_comments, coalition_type) %>% 
  mutate(comment_type = comment_type %>% as.factor()) %>%
  count(comment_type) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  drop_na(comment_type) %>% 
  filter(!comment_type %in% c("NA", "coalition", "mass")) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from =  comment_type, values_from = n) %>%
  arrange(-coalition_comments) %>% 
  kablebox()
```

```{hypothesis, public, echo = TRUE}
Public interest group coalitions mobilize *more often* than private interest group (e.g., business-led) coalitions.
```


```{hypothesis, public-success, echo = TRUE}
Public interest group coalitions mobilize *more successfully* than private interest group (e.g., business-led) coalitions. 
```


```{hypothesis, resources, echo = TRUE}
Public pressure campaigns targeting national policy are most often run by large national policy advocacy organizations.
```


```{hypothesis, disrupt, echo = TRUE}
If narrow private interest groups (e.g., businesses) launch public pressure campaigns, it is a response to an opposing campaign. 
```




# Models of influence/success

## DV = Comments from members of Congress

The relationship between public engagement and legislator engagement can be modeled by Equation \@ref(eq:oversight1) where $Pr(Comment_i)$ is the probability that legislator $i$ comments on a proposed rule, $\beta1$ is the total number of public comments, and $\eta$ is a vector of coefficients on other factors ($X_i$) that may affect whether a legislator engages.



$$logit(Pr(Comment_i)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Number\ of\ comments + \eta X_i + \epsilon_i
(\#eq:oversight1)$$


```{hypothesis oversight, echo = TRUE}
The scale of public engagement moderates elected officials' engagement in agency rulemaking
engagement.
```

```{hypothesis beacon, echo = TRUE}
Public pressure campaigns attract
oversight from allies. The more comments supporting a position, the more
likely principals holding that position are to engage.
```

```{hypothesis warning, echo = TRUE}
Public pressure campaigns
reduce oversight from opponents. The more comments opposing a position,
the less likely principals holding that position are to engage.
```

The probability that legislator $i$ will comment, given their position $p_i$ on a proposed rule ($Pr(Comment_i|p_i)$), is modeled in equation \@ref(eq:oversight2). Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:beacon) implies that $\beta_1$ is positive and
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:warning) implies that $\beta_2$ is negative.


$$logit(Pr(Comment_i|p_i)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Comments supporting } p_i + \beta_2 \text{Comments opposing } p_i + \eta X_i + \epsilon_i
(\#eq:oversight2)$$


## DV = Lobbying succcess

For all three measures of lobbying success, I assess the relationship between lobbying success and mass comments by modeling coalition $i$'s lobbying success, $y_i$ as a combination of the relative length of the (lead) organizations comment, whether the coalition is unopposed, the coalition's size, whether it is a business coalition, and the logged number of mass comments. I estimate these relationships using OLS regression. I also estimate hand-coded lobbying success with beta regression and ordered logit, which is more appropriate but less interpretable. For the automated measures of lobbying success, I estimate beta regression models with the same variables.] 

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 log(comments_i) + \beta_2 length_i + \beta_3 unopposed_i + \beta_4 size_i + \beta_5 business_i + \epsilon_i
$$


### Challenges for inference{-}

#### Non-independence {-}

##### Organzations lobbying in coalitions {-}

The hand-coded sample includes `r nrow(comments_coded)` hand-coded documents representing `r sum(comments_coded$comments)` comments. However, many of these comments belong coalitions and are thus not independent. When Friends of Earth and the Sierra Club lobbying together on a rule, the success of each depends on the other. Thus, I group comments into coalitions. The hand-coded sample includes `r nrow(coalitions_coded)` "coalitions," `r coalitions_coded %>% filter(coalition_size == 1) %>% nrow()` of which are single organizations (not really coalitions), leaving `r coalitions_coded %>% filter(coalition_size > 1) %>% nrow()` true coalitions of groups lobbing together. 

#### Coalitions lobbying on rules

The fact that several coalitions may lobby on the same rule is lesser form of dependence among observations. One coalition's lobbying success is only correlated with another coalitions lobbying success to the extent that they are asking for the same or contradicting things. Because we have grouped organizations into coalitions, the causally-related asks (those organzations lobbying *because* another organization is) are largely accounted for. 



### DV = Coalition success

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 log(comments_i) + \beta_2 length_i + \beta_3 unopposed_i + \beta_4 size_i + \beta_5 business_i + \epsilon_i
$$


```{r model-success, cache=FALSE}
m <- lm(coalition_success ~ 
          log(comments) + 
          #comment_length + 
          coalition_business +  
          coalition_size + 
          coalition_unopposed, 
        data = d) 

modelsummary(m, stars = TRUE)
```


```{r model-success-plot, cache=FALSE,  fig.width=6, fig.height=2, out.width = "100%", fig.cap= "OLS Model of Coalition Lobbying Sucess with Hand-coded Data"}

       x = "")

#### Modeling Congressional Support as a Mediator of Lobbying Success

To assess congressional support as a mediator in the influence of public pressure campaigns on rulemaking, I estimate the average conditional marginal effect (ACME, conditional on the number of comments from Members of Congress) and average direct effect (ADE) of mass comments using mediation analysis. Model 3 in table \@ref(tab:mediation) replaces the dependent variable (lobbying success) with the mediator variable (the number of supportive members of Congress). 

```{r causal-oversight, fig.cap = "The Mediator Model: The Relationship Between Public Pressure and Congressional Oversight"}
#TODO add headers, cut out demands, add political information box, shift principal comments over
#TODO add outcome model
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "causal-oversight-1.png"))
```

Mediator model \@ref(eq:mediator):

$congressional\ support_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 log(comments_i) + \beta_{2-n} X_i + \epsilon_i (\#eq:mediator)$

```{r model-oversight, cache=FALSE}
# model predicting mediator
model.m <- lm(coalition_congress ~  log(comments) + #comment_length +
                coalition_business+  coalition_size + coalition_unopposed, data = d) 

modelsummary(model.m, stars = TRUE)
```


```{r model-oversight-plot, cache=FALSE,  fig.width=6, fig.height=2, out.width = "100%", fig.cap= "OLS Model of the Numeber of Members of Congress Per Coalition with Hand-coded Data"}
model.m %>%
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "grey") + 
  aes(x = term, 
      y = estimate, 
      ymin = conf.low, 
      ymax = conf.high) + 
  geom_pointrange( )  + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "Number of Legislator Comments", 
       x = "") 
```




Outcome ($y_i = Lobbying\ success_i$) model \@ref(eq:outcome):

$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 log(comments_i) + \beta_2 congressional\ support_i + \beta_{3-n} X_i + \epsilon_i (\#eq:outcome)$


```{r mediation, cache=FALSE}
#TODO split out mediator and outcome model tables


# model predicting DV
model.y <- lm(coalition_success ~ log(comments) + coalition_congress + #comment_length +

                          notes = "") %>%
  row_spec(row = 1, bold = T) %>% kable2(file = "mediation")
```

> Mediation analysis will require adding cases where coalitions lobbied unopposed, which we are much more likely to see in the sample of rules without mass comments.



The average effect of the logged number of comments, conditional on letters from members of congress (the ACME) is ` round(med.cont$d.avg, 2)`, with a p value of ` round(med.cont$d0.p, 2)`.

The average direct effect (ADE) of the logged number of comments on lobbying success is ` round(med.cont$z0, 2)`, with a p-value of ` round(med.cont$z0.p, 2)`.

The Total Effect of a one-unit increase in the logged number of comments is ` round(med.cont$tau.coef, 2)`, with a p value of ` round(med.cont$tau.p, 2)`. ` round(med.cont$n0, 2)` of this is mediated through mobilizing congressional attention (p-value = ` round(med.cont$n0.p, 2)`).

### DV = organzation success

While it would not be appropriate to compare the lobbying success of organizations *within* a rule (because many belong to the same coalition), it may be appropriate to compare the lobbying success within the same organzation *across* rules. This limits the analysis to organzations that lobbying on multiple policies. The key variation of interest is when organzations lobby with a large amount of public support.
