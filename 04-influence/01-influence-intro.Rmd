## Introduction

There is little overlap between scholarship on interest group influence and scholarship on mass public pressure. Studies and models of interest group lobbying rarely include public  pressure as a tactic [see @Yackee2019 for a recent review].  Conversely, studies of public pressure rarely include specific policy outcomes as their dependent variable [@Burnstein2019. When they do, they tend to focus on landmark legislation [e.g. @Gillion2013] or a few illustrative cases [@Mansbridge1992; @Rochon1993; @Yackee2009PSJ].


### Interest Group Influence

<!-- > TODO  -->

Interest groups--particularly the distinction between those that represent broad and narrow interests--foundational scholarship in both American politics [@Lowi1969 ] and bureaucracy.
Wilson's famous typology of government agencies is fundamentally linked to the kinds of interest group pressures agencies may face. For example a client agency, formed to support a sector of activity will deal with narrow groups while a regulatory agency may struggle to persist if the broad-based public interest groups that support it loses power.  

> "A client agency will have to struggle mightily to avoid having its work influenced by the single, organized group with which it must deal on a daily basis. Many do not succeed; a few do not even try." [@Wilson1989, pg.79]

> SECOND WILSON QUOTE 

For studies attempting to study interest group influence, measuring lobbying success is a major challenge [@Mahoney2007JPP, @Yackee2006JOP, @Rashin2017].

### Public Pressure

> TODO Review theory section.


Public engagement in rulemaking is highly
clustered on a few rules made salient by public pressure campaigns. 

<!-- Why Public Pressure May NOT Affect Agency Decisions-->

Responding to public pressure campaigns, agency officials often reject the notion that public pressure should inform their decisions.

>"A rough estimate of pro and con submissions by individuals may provide insight as to public interest in a topic and to individual consumer experiences. However, under both the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bureau must base its determinations in rulemaking on the facts and the law in the rulemaking record as a whole." ([CFPB-2020-14935](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-14935/p-134)

<!-- Why Public Pressure May Affect Agency Decisions-->

It is
plausible that at least some of the time, these campaigns aim to
influence policy. It is also plausible that thousands of people engaging
may alter the politics of these policy processes [@, but this hypothesis
remains untested.

<!--To address this gap, -->
To address this gap, I assess the relationship between the number of
public comments and the amount of change between draft and final policy
texts. Next, I assess the relationship between the number of people
mobilized by each campaign and whether the campaign achieved its policy
goals. Finally, I theorize and test four mechanisms by which public
input may affect bureaucratic policymaking. Each mechanism involves a
distinct type of information that pressure campaigns may relay to
policymakers: technical information, information about the likelihood of
political consequences, information about the preferences of elected
officials, or information about the preferences of the attentive public.
Because scholarship on bureaucratic policymaking has focused on the
power of technical information, where insider lobbying is most likely to
matter and where outside strategies are least likely to matter,
political scientists have largely overlooked public pressure campaigns as a lobbying
tactic.

I find evidence consistent with the observable implications of mass
comment campaigns influencing policymaking through [non-null results]
but no evidence that mass engagement affects rulemaking processes or
outcomes through [null results].
