## Introduction

There is little overlap between scholarship on interest group influence and scholarship on mass public pressure. Studies and models of interest group lobbing rarely include pubic pressure as a tactic. Studies of public pressure rarely include specific policy outcomes as their dependent variable. When they do, the tend to focus on landmark policies.

### Public Pressure

> TODO Review theory section.

Social movements and activist pressure occasionally lead to the creattion of new agencies, but these agencies may be left voulerable when pressure wanes. 

Public engagement in rulemaking is highly
clustered on a few rules made salient by public pressure campaigns. It is
plausible that at least some of the time, these campaigns aim to
influence policy. It is also plausible that thousands of people engaging
may alter the politics of these policy processes, but this hypothesis
remains untested.

<!--To address this gap, -->
To address this gap, I assess the relationship between the number of
public comments and the amount of change between draft and final policy
texts. Next, I assess the relationship between the number of people
mobilized by each campaign and whether the campaign achieved its policy
goals. Finally, I theorize and test four mechanisms by which public
input may affect bureaucratic policymaking. Each mechanism involves a
distinct type of information that pressure campaigns may relay to
policymakers: technical information, information about the likelihood of
political consequences, information about the preferences of elected
officials, or information about the preferences of the attentive public.
Because scholarship on bureaucratic policymaking has focused on the
power of technical information, where insider lobbying is most likely to
matter and where outside strategies are least likely to matter,
political scientists have largely overlooked public pressure campaigns as a lobbying
tactic.

I find evidence consistent with the observable implications of mass
comment campaigns influencing policymaking through [non-null results]
but no evidence that mass engagement affects rulemaking processes or
outcomes through [null results].
