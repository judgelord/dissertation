### Interest Group Influence

> TODO  Scholars have avoided studying interest group influence because of the difficulty measuring lobbying success [@Mahoney2007JPP].

### Public Pressure

> TODO This section needs to be more general overview. Details later.

While "ordinary" members of the public may occasionally provide novel
and useful technical information to expert bureaucrats, such
sophisticated means of influencing policy are out of reach for the vast
majority of people. Thus, to investigate the potential role of ordinary
people in bureaucratic politics I look elsewhere---not because ordinary
people never provide novel and useful technical information, but because
this is not how most people attempt to influence policy, nor, I argue,
how we should expect ordinary people to have influence.

Most public comments are, in fact, of the type suggested by the
solicitations on Regulations.gov---ordinary people voicing opinions on a proposed policy. They do not provide useful technical information or
suggest specific edits to policy texts like the interest group comments
that have thus far captured the attention of political scientists. If
they add information to rulemaking, it is a different, more political
flavor of information. 

Public engagement in rulemaking is highly
clustered on a few rules made salient by these campaigns. It is
plausible that at least some of the time, such campaigns aim to
influence policy. It is also plausible that thousands of people engaging
may alter the politics of these policy processes, but this hypothesis
remains untested.

Depending on how agencies process political information, "going public" may occasionally be an effective strategy for organizations to influence policy, both directly and indirectly. However, influencing policy may not be the only reason to mobilize.

<!--To address this gap, -->
I assess the relationship between the number of
public comments and the amount of change between draft and final policy
texts. Next, I assess the relationship between the number of people
mobilized by each campaign and whether the campaign achieved its policy
goals. Finally, I theorize and test four mechanisms by which public
input may affect bureaucratic policymaking. Each mechanism involves a
distinct type of information that pressure campaigns may relay to
policymakers: technical information, information about the likelihood of
political consequences, information about the preferences of elected
officials, or information about the preferences of the attentive public.
Because scholarship on bureaucratic policymaking has focused on the
power of technical information, where insider lobbying is most likely to
matter and where outside strategies are least likely to matter,
political scientists have largely overlooked mass mobilization as a
tactic.

I find evidence consistent with the observable implications of mass
comment campaigns influencing policymaking through [non-null results]
but no evidence that mass engagement affects rulemaking processes or
outcomes through [null results].

## Theory {#influence-theory}

Scholars of bureaucratic policymaking have focused on
the sophisticated lobbying efforts of powerful interest groups such as
business coalitions. A key insight from this scholarship is that
technical information is the currency of insider lobbying. Figure
\@ref(fig:causal-classic2) illustrates the classic causal
model of insider lobbying that describes most rulemakings and nearly all
scholarship on lobbying in bureaucratic policymaking to date.^[Diamonds indicate observable choices, ovals indicate latent preferences, and rectangles indicate information.]
However, public pressure campaigns hav no place in this model. I aim to fill this
gap.

#### Public pressure is a political resource.

An organization's ability to expand the scope of conflict by mobilizing
a large number of people can be a valuable political resource [@Schattschneider1975]. In contrast to scholars who focus on the deliberative
potential of public comment processes, I focus on public engagement as a
tactic aimed at gaining power. Scholars who understand mobilization
as a tactic [@Furlong1997; @Kerwin2011] have focused on how
organizations mobilize their membership. I expand on this understanding of mobilization as a lobbying tactic to include a campaign's broader audience, more akin to the concept of
an attentive public [@Key1961] or issue public [@Converse1964].

Here I build on three insights. First, @Furlong1997 and @Kerwin2011
identify mobilization as a tactic. The organizations that they surveyed
reported that forming coalitions and mobilizing large numbers of people
are among the most effective lobbying tactics. Second, @Nelson2012
identify political information as a potentially influential result of
lobbying by different business coalitions. While they focus on
mobilizing experts, I argue that @Nelson2012 describe a dynamic that can be extended
to mass commenting:

> "strategic recruitment, we theorize, mobilizes new actors to
> participate in the policymaking process, bringing with them novel
> technical and political information. In other words, when an expanded
> strategy is employed, leaders activate individuals and organizations
> to participate in the policymaking process who, without the
> coordinating efforts of the leaders, would otherwise not lobby. This
> activation is important because it implies that coalition lobbying can
> generate new information and new actors---beyond simply the 'usual
> suspects'---relevant to policy decisionmakers. Thus, we theorize
> consensus, coalition size, and composition matter to policy change."

Concerning political information, this logic extends to
non-experts. The number and distribution of ordinary supporters may
matter because it suggests a *public* consensus. Instead of bolstering
*scientific* claims, a perceived public consensus bolsters *political*
claims. Finally, @Furlong1998, @Yackee2006JPART, and others distinguish
between direct and indirect forms of interest group influence in
rulemaking. This distinction is especially important for political
information, which may be most influential through indirect channels,
such as through elected officials. In short, to understand how groups
lobby in rulemaking, we must understand mass mobilization as a tactic
aimed at producing political information that may have direct and
indirect impacts on policymaking.

While most scholars have emphasized mass comments' lack of useful
technical information, a few have raised their role in creating
political information. @Cuellar2005 calls on agencies to pay more
attention to ordinary peoples' expressions of preference and @Rauch2016
suggests that agencies reform the public comment process to include
opinion polls. I build from a similar intuition that mass comment
campaigns currently function like a poll or, more accurately, a
petition, capturing the intensity of preferences among the attentive
public---i.e., how many people are willing to take the time to
engage.^[For example, a campaign by the World Wildlife Federation provided
    language explicitly claiming to have public opinion on their side.
    Their model comment stated that "Along with 80% of the American
    people, I strongly support ending commercial trade in elephant ivory
    in the US." This suggests that mass comment campaigns aim to signal
    information about public opinion.] Self-selection may not be ideal for representation, but
opt-in participation---whether voting, attending a hearing, or writing a
comment---may often be one of the few heuristics decisionmakers have
about public preferences.

Mobilizing citizens and generating new political information are key
functions of interest groups in a democracy
[@Mansbridge1992; @Mahoney2007]. Campaigns inform agencies about the
distribution and intensity of opinions that are often too nuanced to
estimate a priori. Many questions that arise in rulemaking lack
analogous public opinion polling questions, making mass commenting a
unique source of political information. As with public opinion on many
specific policy issues, most members of the public and their elected
representatives may only learn about the issue and take a position as a
result of a public pressure campaign [@Hutchings2003]. I thus consider
public demands to be a latent factor in my model of policymaking (Figure
\@ref(fig:causal-whymail2). Public demands shape the decisions of
groups who lobby in rulemaking. If they believe the attentive public is
on their side, groups may attempt to reveal this political information
to policymakers by launching a mass mobilization campaign. The public
response to the campaign depends on the extent that the attentive public
is passionate about the issue.

```{r causal-whymail2, fig.cap = "Incorporating Political Information into Models of Bureaucratic Policymaking"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "causal-whymail.png"))

```

Figure \@ref(fig:causal-whymail2) amends the "Classic Model" of interest
group lobbying (Figure \@ref(fig:causal-classic2)) to incorporate political information about the attentive public. In addition to providing technical information through sophisticated comments, an organization may mobilize supporters.
The more latent public support a group has, the more successful this mobilization effort will be.
Large-scale engagement may produce several types of relevant political
information. The most direct and obvious is the expressed "public
opinion" that policymakers observe.^[I address other types of political information that mass engagement may create elsewhere. For an expanded model, see Figure
    \@ref(fig:causal-full2).

> TODO: more theorizing and literature development on the direct lobbying link.

<!--
Needs more theorizing and literature development on the direct lobbying link.  This must be informed by a greater breadth of literature (and must go beyond Libgober).  I found the quasi-formalization unhelpful and would have preferred that you spend more time developing why mass commenting campaigns may matter AND tying this to the leader organizations and group mediated participation.  We need theory here, which builds on literature.
i.	In doing so, perhaps explain more the idea of political information and why it creates a direct lobbying link for mass commenters
ii.	Need to discuss Jewell and Bero (JPART) somewhere.

•	Is it REALLY mass commenters who hold the influence here when you are not measuring the content of their comments but instead the commenter provided by the leader (which might be much longer, technical, and more sophisticated than the mass comments)? 
i.	Spend more time justifying why, on page 58, we should use the much longer substantive comments to represent the mass mobilization effort? 
•	How do regulators view these mass comments?  Are they only concerned with the longer, leader comment (and the mass comments say how much they should really “care” about the leader’s comments)?  Then, is this really democratizing?
-->

The causal process visualized in Figure
\@ref(fig:causal-whymail2) may only operate under certain conditions. The success of a mobilizing effort depends on whether a group's perception of latent public demands (the diagonal arrow between "Latent Public Demands" and "Lobbying Strategy") reflects the public response to a mobilizing effort (the horizontal arrow between "Latent Public Demands" and "Mass Engagement"). 

The influence of political information on policy (the arrow between "Political Information" and "Policy Response") depends on the institutional processes by which agencies receive and interpret information. We may only expect to observe mass mobilization influencing a particular policy only if the mobilization effort was aimed at influencing that policy, rather than using the public comment the period to build organizational membership or power more generally (see @Carpenter2014b).

#### Mass comment campaigns

Understanding civic participation in rulemaking as a mediated process aimed at generating political information posits a different role for mass comment campaigns than that posited by existing (albiet limited) literature on this topic.

> TODO Critique of Balla et al., Review @Cook2017



Agencies respond to mass comment campaigns in different ways

When 

When public , agencies reject the notion that mass comment should inform their decisions.

>"A rough estimate of pro and con submissions by individuals may provide insight as to public interest in a topic and to individual consumer experiences. However, under both the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bureau must base its determinations in rulemaking on the facts and the law in the rulemaking record as a whole."

### Incorporating political information into formal models of rulemaking {#formal}

Formally, political information requires several crucial amendments to
existing information-based models of rulemaking. In the most
sophisticated model of notice-and-comment rulemaking to date,
@Libgober2018 posits a utility function for agency $G$ as
$u_G(x_F) = \alpha_0 x_f^2 + \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i u_i (x_f)$ where
$x_f$ is the spatial location of the final policy, $u_i$ is the
preference of a member of the public or "potential commenter" $i$, and
$\alpha$ is a vector of \"allocational bias\"---i.e. how much the agency
cares about its own preferences $\alpha_0$ relative to accommodating the
preferences of others $\alpha_{i=1:N}$. Bureaucrats balance their own
idea of their mission against their desire to be responsive. In
Libgober's model, $\alpha$ is a fixed "taste" for responsiveness to each
member of society, so agency decisions simply depend on their answer to
the question "what do people want?" Including political information
requires two additional parameters related to a second question "why
would the agency care?"

First, like other lobbying strategies, going public may shift the
strategic environment, leading an agency to shift its allocation in
favor of some groups and away from others. Let this strategic shift be a
vector $\alpha_s$. Second, campaigns may directly persuade agencies to
adjust their allocational bias, for example by supporting claims about
the number of people the group represents or the intensity or legitimacy
of their policy demands. Let this direct shift be $\alpha_d$ and
immutable taste now be $\alpha_t$. Having decomposed an agency's
allocative bias into three parts (its fixed tastes, shifting strategic
environment, and potential to be convinced), the agency's utility
function is now
$u_G(x_F) =  (\alpha_{t0} + \alpha_{s0} + \alpha_{d0}) x_f^2 + \sum_{i=1}^N (\alpha_{ti} + \alpha_{si} + \alpha_{di}) u_i (x_f)$.
If, after the comment period, an agency's strategic environment is
unchanged and it remains unpersuaded about which segments of society
deserve favor, $\alpha_s$ and $\alpha_d$ are 0, and the model collapses
to the original information game based on fixed taste. This less
plausible when groups go public and expand the scope of conflict.

Incorperating political information allows us to begin formalizing
intuitions about mechanisms of influence. For example, @Libgober2018
asks "What proportion of commenting activity can be characterized as
informing regulators about public preferences versus attempting to
attract attention of other political principals?" (p. 29). Adding
political information to the model allows us to formalize this question:
Under what conditions does the decision to comment depend on an
organization's beliefs about $\alpha_t$ versus beliefs about $\alpha_s$?
Empirically, we may often be able to infer that the difference in
commenting can be attributed to group $i$'s beliefs about $\alpha_{si}$
if the behavior of political principals varies but other observed
parameter values are similar across rules at a given agency.

Rational-choice explanations of why organizations comment on proposed
rules build on an intuition that potential commenters will comment only
when the benefits exceed the costs of doing so. This intuition ought to
apply to other lobbying strategies such as mass mobilization as well.
Adding an additional lobbying strategy into the model described above is
straightforward. In Libgober's model, a potential commenter has negative
quadratic preferences centered on their ideal policy $p_i$ and
$u_i = -(x_f - p_i)^2$ where $x_f$ is the final policy chosen by the
agency. An organization will comment if the cost of doing so is less
than the difference between their utility when the agency selects a
policy having been informed about the organization's ideal point $p_i$
versus when the agency selects a policy having made a guess about the
organization's ideal point, $z_i$. If $c_i$ is organization $i$'s cost
of commenting, then $i$ will comment if it expects to be better off
providing information than abstaining
$E[u_i | p_i] > E[u_i | z_i] + c_i$. Similarly, an organization will go
public when it expects that the cost of running a mass mobilization
campaign to be less than the difference in utility when the agency
selects a policy having been informed about the intensity of broader
public preferences $p_{public}$ versus when the agency selects a policy
having made a guess about the intensity of the attentive public's
preferences, $z_{public}$. If $c_{campaign, i}$ is organization $i$'s
cost of running a mass mobilization campaign, then $i$ will launch a
campaign if
$E[u_i | p_{public}] > E[u_i | z_{public}] + c_{campaign, i}$. This
suggests that mass mobilization with the aim of influencing policy, i.e.
going public, should be more common when agencies are either poorly
informed or distant from public opinion and potentially influenced by
the types of political information created by mass engagement.

Additionally, an organization may comment or run a mass mobilization
campaign if it benefits in ways that are independent of policy outcomes.
Strategies such as \"going down fighting\" can be incorporated by adding
exogenous benefit parameters to the utility function of the potential
commenter/mobilizer. Let $v_i$ be the benefit of commenting independent
of its effect on the policy outcome, such as pleasing members or to
reserving the right to sue. Let $w_i$ be the benefit of running a mass
mobilization campaign independent of its effect on the outcome of the
policy at hand, such as fulfilling expectations of existing members or
recruiting new members. An organizations utility function would then be
$u_i = -(x - p_i)^2 + v_i + w_i$.

Adding these parameters also resolves a puzzling result of Libgober's
model. Empirically, rules that receive comments do not always change.
This result is impossible in a model where bureaucrats only have known
fixed tastes and potential commenters only seek changes in policy. For
policy seeking organizations to lobby but fail to influence policy
requires that they may either be wrong about an agency's allocative bias
or their ability to shift it. Incorporating political information allows
change and uncertainty in an agency's biases. The result of commenting
without rule change also becomes possible if commenters are allowed a
strategy of "going down fighting" and incentives to do so.
