### Methods 

The most direct way to assess the hypothesis that mass engagement increases lobbying success is to assess the relationship between the number of comments that a coalition mobilizes and its lobbying success. However, public pressure campaigns may only be effective under certain conditions. Thus, I first assess the main relationship and then assess evidence for or against different potential causal pathways of influence. The main indirect pathway by which campaigns may influence agency policymaking is through engaging members of Congress. Finally, is use a difference-in-difference design to assess variation in success *within* organzations lobbying that lobby on multiple rules.

### Modeling the Direct Relationship Between Public Pressure and Lobbying Success

I assess the relationship between lobbying success and the scale of public pressure it mobilizes by modeling the success of coalition $i$, $y_i$, as a function of the number of mass comments supporting that coalition, $commnets_i$. All models use either the logged number of comments or include a quadradic term to account for the different marginal effect of additional public comments for smaller and larger campaigns. The main specifications include president and agency fixed effects and control for <!-- of the relative length of the (lead) organizations comment, --> 
whether the coalition is lobbying unopposed, the coalition's size (the number of distinct organizations and elected officials), and the type of coalition (e.g. whether it is a business-led coalition or a public-interest coalition) and include agency fixed effects. I estimate these relationships using OLS regression. <!--I also estimate hand-coded lobbying success with beta regression and ordered logit, which is more appropriate but less interpretable. For the automated measures of lobbying success, I estimate beta regression models with the same variables.-->




\begin{equation} 
y_{ijp} = \beta_1 log(comments_{ijp}) + \beta_3 unopposed_{ijp} + \beta_4 size_{ijp} + \beta_5 business_{ijp} +  \alpha_j + \gamma_p + \epsilon_{ijp} (\#eq:success)
\end{equation} 



Comment-level observations are nested within an organization, within a coalition, within a rule, within an agency, within an administration. I use a combination of fixed and random effects to account for dependence among observations at higher levels of analysis. The main models use data at the organization level and rolled up to the coalition level (coalitions range from 1 to 200 organizations in size).

The dependent variable for most analysis is the organization or coalition's lobbying success, hand-coded on the interval between 2 (total success; the policy changed as requested) to -2 (total loss; the policy changed in the opposite direction requested). 

The main variable of interest is the total number of form-letter public comments that a lobbying coalition generated. 

I assess the relationship between lobbying success and public pressure by modeling coalition $i$'s lobbying success in a rulemaking $j$, $y_{ij}$ as a combination of
<!--the relative length of the (lead) organizations comment,--> 
the coalition's size, and the number of mass comments (logged in some specifications), the type of coalition (e.g. a business or public interest coalition), whether the coalition supported the proposed rule, and whether the coalition lobbied unopposed. I estimate these relationships using OLS regression. Other estimators yield similar results. <!--I also estimate hand-coded lobbying success with beta regression and ordered logit, which is more appropriate but less interpretable. For the automated measures of lobbying success, I estimate beta regression models with the same variables.-->





y_{ijp} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 log(comments_{ijp}) + \beta_{2:n} X_{ijp} +  \alpha_j + \gamma_p + \epsilon_{ijp} (\#eq:successFE)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
Y_{ij} = \boldsymbol{\beta}_1 \textbf{log(Comments)}_{ij} + {\beta}_2\text{Size}_{ij} + {\beta}_3\text{Unopposed}_{ij}  + {\beta}_3\text{Coalition Type}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}
\end{equation}




### Modeling Congressional Support as a Mediator of Lobbying Success

To assess congressional support as a mediator in the influence of public pressure campaigns on rulemaking, I estimate the average conditional marginal effect (ACME) and the proportion of the total effect attributed to mediation through congressional support (comments or other communication from Members of Congress supporting the coalition's position on the proposed rule). As developed by Imai et al. (2010), this involves first estimating a model of the potential mediator as a combination of covariates, $X$ (*length*, *unopposed*, *size*, and *business*) and then the outcome as a combination of the mediator, *congressional support*, and covariates, $X$.

The bold arrow in figure \@ref(fig:causal-oversight) indicates the key relationship
that I test in this step: the relationship between the scale of
public engagement and engagement from members of Congress, who may
receive political information (e.g., about the level of public attention or public opinion) from public pressure campaigns and the resulting mass commenting.

```{r causal-oversight, fig.cap = "The Mediator Model: The Relationship Between Public Pressure and Congressional Oversight"}
#TODO add headers, cut out demands, add political information box, shift principal comments over
#TODO add outcome model
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "causal-oversight-1.png"))
```

Mediator model \@ref(eq:mediator):

\begin{equation}
\text{Congressional support}_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 log(\text{Pressure Campaign}_{ij}) + \beta_{2-n} X_{ij} + \gamma_k + \delta_p + \epsilon_{ij} (\#eq:mediator)
\end{equation}

The outcome model (Equasion \@ref(eq:outcome)) is the same as Equasion \@ref(eq:success), except that it now includes the number of supportive comments from members of Congress as a predictor. $y_i$ is Lobbying success of coalition $i$ on rule $j$ published by agency $k$ under president $p$, Pressure Campaign$_{ijk}$ is whether the coalition organized a pressure campaign, Congressional Support$_{ikj}$ is the number of members of Congress supporting the coalition, and $X_{ijk}$ are other coalition-level predictors of lobbying success.

\begin{equation}
Y_{ijk} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Pressure Campaign}_{ijk} + \beta_2 \text{Congressional Support}_{ijk} \beta_{2-n} X_{ijk} + \gamma_k + \delta_p + \epsilon_{ijk} (\#eq:outcome)
\end{equation}

The next section presents results from estimating the above models using the hand-coded data.
