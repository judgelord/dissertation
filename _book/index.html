<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Does civic engagement through public pressure campaigns affect agency rulemaking? I examine who participates in public pressure campaigns and why, whether they affect congressional oversight, and whether they affect policy. Answering these questions informs our understanding of bureaucratic politics and interest group lobbying, organizing, and mobilizing tactics. If ordinary people have a voice in bureaucratic policymaking, I argue, it is through public pressure campaings. Thus, understnding the nature and effects of these campaigns is key to understanding modern democracy.</p>

<p>With the rise of the administrative state, U.S. federal agencies have
become a major site of policymaking and political conflict. By some
estimates, upward of 90% of legally binding U.S. federal policy is now
written by agencies. Agency rules are revised much more frequently than
statutory law <span class="citation">(Wagner et al. <a href="#ref-Wagner2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, and in the years or decades between
legislative enactments, federal agencies make legally-binding rules
interpreting and reinterpreting old statutes to address emerging issues
and priorities. Examples are striking: The effect of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was largely unknown until the
specific regulations were written, and it continues to change as these
rules are revised. Congress authorizes billions in farm subsidies, and
leases for public lands, but who gets them depends on agency policy. In
the decades since the last major environmental legislation, agencies
have written thousands of pages of new environmental regulations and
thousands more changing tack under each new administration. These
revisions significantly shape lives and fortunes. For example, in 2006,
citing the authority of statutes last amended in the 1950s, the Justice
Department’s Bureau of Prisons proposed a rule restricting eligibility
for parole. In 2016, the Bureau withdrew this rule and announced it
would require fewer contracts with private prison companies,
precipitating a 50% loss of industry stock value. Six months later, a
new attorney general announced these policies would again be reversed,
leading to a 130% increase in industry stock value. Agency rulemaking
matters.</p>
<p>Less clear, however, is how the new centrality of agency rulemaking fits
with democracy. In addition to the bureaucracy’s complex relationships with
the president and Congress, agencies have complex and poorly understood
relationships with the public and advocacy groups. Relationships with
constituent groups may even provide agencies with a degree of “autonomy” from their official principals <span class="citation">(Carpenter <a href="#ref-Carpenter2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Participatory processes like public comment periods, where government
agencies must solicit public input on draft policies, are said to
provide political oversight opportunities <span class="citation">(Balla <a href="#ref-Balla1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>; Mccubbins and Schwartz <a href="#ref-Mccubbins1984" role="doc-biblioref">1984</a>)</span>,
democratic legitimacy <span class="citation">(Croley <a href="#ref-Croley2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Rosenbloom <a href="#ref-Rosenbloom2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>, and new technical
information <span class="citation">(Yackee <a href="#ref-Yackee2006JPART" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>; Nelson and Yackee <a href="#ref-Nelson2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. While recent scholarship on
agency policymaking has shed light on the sophisticated lobbying by
businesses and political insiders, we know surprisingly little about the
vast majority of public comments which are submitted by ordinary people
as part of public pressure campaigns.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Activists frequently target
agency policymaking with letter-writing campaigns, petitions, protests,
and mobilizing people to attend hearings, all classic examples of “civic
engagement” <span class="citation">(Verba and Nie <a href="#ref-Verba1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span>. Yet civic engagement remains poorly understood
in the context of bureaucratic policymaking.</p>
<p>These occasional bursts of civic engagement in bureaucratic policymaking
raise practical and theoretical questions for the practice of
democracy.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> These questions, in turn, hinge on unanswered empirical
questions: Do these campaigns affect policy? If so, by what mechanisms?
Existing research finds that commenters believe their comments matter
<span class="citation">(Yackee <a href="#ref-Yackee2015JPART" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> and that the number of public comments varies across
agencies and policy processes
<span class="citation">(Judge-Lord <a href="#ref-Judge-Lord2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>; Libgober <a href="#ref-Libgober2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>; Moore <a href="#ref-Moore2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, but the relationship
between the scale of public engagement and policy change remains
untested.</p>
<p>To address this gap, I assess the relationship between the number of
public comments and the amount of change between draft and final policy
texts. Next, I assess the relationship between the number of people
mobilized by each campaign and whether the campaign achieved its policy
goals. Finally, I theorize and test four mechanisms by which public
input may affect bureaucratic policymaking. Each mechanism involves a
distinct type of information that pressure campaigns may relay to
policymakers: technical information, information about the likelihood of
political consequences, information about the preferences of elected
officials, or information about the preferences of the attentive public.
Because scholarship on bureaucratic policymaking has focused on the
power of technical information, where insider lobbying is most likely to
matter and where outside strategies are least likely to matter,
political scientists have largely overlooked mass mobilization as a
tactic.</p>
<p>I find evidence consistent with the observable implications of mass
comment campaigns influencing policymaking through <span class="math display">\[non-null results\]</span>
but no evidence that mass engagement affects rulemaking processes or
outcomes through <span class="math display">\[null results\]</span>.</p>

<div id="motivation" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Leading models of influence in bureaucratic policymaking focus on two key political forces: sophisticated interest group lobbying and political oversight.
As bureaucrats learn about policy problems and balance interest-group demands, public comment processes allow lobbying organizations to provide useful technical information and inform decisionmakers of their preferences on draft policies.
Agencies may then update policy positions within constraints imposed by their political principals.</p>
<p>While this may describe most cases of bureaucratic policymaking, these models do not explain or account for the contentious politics that occasionally inspire millions of ordinary people to respond to calls for public input on draft agency policies. Mass engagement in bureaucratic policymaking has thus largely been ignored by political scientists, leaving a weak empirical base for normative and prescriptive work.
Like other forms of mass political participation, such as protests and letter writing campaigns,
mass public comments on draft agency rules provide no new technical information. <!--%In this sense, they are not useful. -->
Nor do they wield any formal authority to reward or sanction bureaucrats, as comments from a Members of Congress might.
The number on each side, be it ten or ten million, has no legal import for an agency’s response.</p>
<!--
% Policymakers may very well pay no attention to them. 
%Instead, scholars focus on the sophisticated lobbying efforts of powerful interest groups, whose role in shaping policy has been theoretically developed and empirically tested.

<p>How, if at all, should scholars incorporate mass engagement into models of bureaucratic policymaking?</p>

<h2>Outline of the book</h2>
<!--Does mass engagement in bureaucratic policymaking affect policy? This question drives my project. However, two questions must be answered first: (1) Why does it occur? and (2) How does it affect political oversight? These questions drive two initial empirical chapters. Thus, my analysis has three steps. 

First, I theorize that activists' opportunities and strategies and latent public opinion drive engagement. 

Second, I theorize that mass engagement affects political oversight. 

Third, I theorize that mass engagement may affect rulemaking, both directly, and indirectly via its effect on political oversight. -->
<p>This project aims to better understand the role of ordinary people in bureaucratic policymaking.
I develop theories of why mass engagement occurs and how it may affect policy. To assess these theories, I tackle three related empirical questions: (1) Why does it occur?; (2) How does it affect the oversight behaviors of agencies’ political principals?; and <!--These questions drive two initial empirical chapters.-->
(3) Does mass engagement in bureaucratic policymaking affect policy?
<!-- I then use my new measures of the political information that lobbying coalitions create by going public to test whether mass engagement explains variation in agency rulemaking and rules.<!-- But first, I must develop a measure of "going public." <!-- and why it occurs.--></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 1 situates agency rulemaking in the context of American politics.</strong> I show that rulemaking is a major site of policymaking and political conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2 explains why agencies (occasionally) get so much mail.</strong>
<!-- Scholars of bureaucratic policymaking have focused on the sophisticated lobbying efforts of powerful interest groups. Yet agencies occasionally receive thousands or even millions of comments from ordinary people. Why? Why do individuals comment when they seemingly have no new information to offer and no power to influence decisions? Who inspires them, and to what end? How, if at all, should scholars incorporate mass commenting into models of bureaucratic policymaking? I argue that mass commenting produces political information about the coalition that mobilized it. -->
<!-- QUESTION 1 **Puzzle:** -->
<!--Why do some rules receive many comments from ordinary people and some do not?
<!-- Why do people comment on draft policies when they seem to have no new information to offer and no power to influence decisions? Who inspires them, and to what end? -->
<!-- THEORY AND METHODS 1-->
<!-- Answering this question requires a theory explaining variation in mass engagement. -->
The literature suggests two possible explanations for variation in mass engagement; groups may leverage public support as a lobbying resource (“grassroots” mobilization) or groups with more resources may leverage those resources into an impression of public support (sometimes called “astroturf”).
<!--Using new measures of public engagement in agency rulemaking, I identify the conditions under which it occurs and produces different politically-relevant information. -->
<!-- The dependent variable is the number of people engaged.-->
I find that public interest campaigns explain variation in mass engagement. Unlike other forms of lobbying, it is not primarily driven by interests with the largest financial stakes and resources. <!--Specifically, I anticipate three patterns:
(1) When a coalition is disadvantaged in insider politics but as more public support than opposing coalitions, they are more likely to "go public" to bolster their lobbying effort (assuming they have the resources to do so). More public support yields more engagement, more effort per participant, and contagion beyond those mobilized directly. (2) Coalitions with less support may "counter-mobilize." However, with proportionally smaller results. That is, groups with more resources but less public support only mobilize when their opponents do so. (3) Finally, coalitions may mobilize for reasons unrelated to the policy at hand, yielding significant mass engagement but without a corresponding insider lobbying effort. -->
Because the vast majority of comments are inspired by interest-group campaigns, finding their cause requires a method to link comments to the lobbying coalitions that mobilized them. To link individual comments to the more sophisticated lobbying efforts they support, I use text reuse and clustering methods to capture formal and informal coalitions. <!--Measures of mass engagement include -->
<!--(1) total public comments, --><!-- $\sim$ zero-inflated negative binomial; -->
<!--(1) comments per coalition, <!-- $\sim$ negative binomial; -->
<!--(2) effort per comment, <!-- $\sim$ truncated normal; -->
<!--(3) share of comments per coalition mobilized indirectly (i.e. the potential for conflict spread).
With measures, I test whether variation in engagement explains variation in oversight behavior (part 2) and policy outcomes (part 3).
<!-- (4) type of campaign. <!-- $\sim$ multinomial. -->
<!--Model 1 is one observation per rule. Models 2-4 are one observation per coalition per rule. Explanatory variables include agency alignment with Congress and the president (models 1-4), coalition alignment and unity (models 2-4), whether a coalition is driven more by public or private interests (models 2-3).<!--, part of the DV in model 4).--></p>
<!--**Step 2. Are elected officials more or less likely to engage after mass public engagement?** -->
<p><strong>Chapter 3 asks whether mass engagement affect political oversight.</strong> The political information signaled by mass engagement may serve as “fire alarms,” altering principals to oversight opportunities or “warning signs” altering them to political risks.
When a coalition mobilizes successfully, <!--especially if it generates a perceived consensus in expressed public sentiments, -->
elected officials ought to be more likely to engage on their behalf and less likely to engage against them.
<!-- This suggests an addendum to Hall and Miler's (2008) finding that members are more likely to engage in rulemaking when they have been lobbied by a like-minded interest group.-->
<!-- When interest groups lobby elected officials to engage in rulemaking, they may be more likely to engage when aligned with most commenters than when opposed.-->
<!-- If politicians learn from political information, they will be even more likely to engage when lobbied by a coalition that includes a public interest group with a large mass-comment campaign, and less likely when lobbied by a coalition dominated by private interests opposed by a mass comment campaign. -->
<!-- MEASUREMENT  2-->
To assess these hypotheses, I count the number of times Members of Congress engage the agency before, during, and after comment periods on rules where lobbying organizations did and did not go public. I then use text analysis to compare legislators’ sentiments and rhetoric to that used by each coalition.
<!-- Similarly, I assess the involvement of presidential appointees and the President's Office of Management and Budget before and after public comment, again comparing rules that were and were not targeted by a campaign (a difference-in-difference). -->
<!-- As a validity check, I also look for remarks by elected officials and judges on the level of public engagement.
Dependent variables include -->
<!--(1) the number of comments from Members of Congress on the rule <!--(total, those mentioning mass comments, and those mentioning organizations in the coalition), <!--All  $\sim$ zero-inflated negative binomial. -->
<!--(2) the share of supportive congressional comments, <!--  $\sim$  beta. -->
<!--(3) the similarity of words in comments from the coalition and Members of Congress. --></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4 asks whether mass engagement affects rulemaking and rules.</strong>
I theorize that the effects of political information on policy depend on the extent to which the strategic environment allows change and how political information is processed, both directly within agencies and indirectly through other actors (e.g., Members of Congress) whose appraisals matter to bureaucrats.
The main dependent variable is change in the rule text.
<!--Different inputs may yield different results: -->
I systematically identify changes between draft and final rules, parse these differences to identify meaningful policy changes, and compare them to demands raised in comments to measure which coalition got their desired outcomes.<!-- However, assessing policy change is difficult. Thus, I also use other measures of agency responses to lobbying efforts. --></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5 presents a case study of the environmental justice movement.</strong> I identify all rules where “environmental justice” is raised in the comments to assess agency responses both quantitatively and qualitatively. In preliminary analysis, I find that responsiveness to environmental justice activist comments varies in predictable ways across agencies, but I find no evidence that the total number of comments affects rules.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 6</strong> concludes with remarks on the study of bureaucratic policymaking and policy recommendations to better account for the fact that public pressure campaigns and the bursts of civic engagement they mobilize will be an enduring feature of the policy process.</p>
<!-- The following section outlines methodologies to assess my three overarching questions and their component parts. These methods rely on an analysis of comment and policy texts as large-n observational data. 

<!-- To explore causal arguments, the last two chapters of the dissertation will explore historical and experimental case studies. My historical case is the environmental justice movement, relying on all rules where "environmental justice" is raised in the comments and quantitative and qualitative assessment of agency responses. This prospectus includes a preliminary analysis of the environmental justice case study. I find that responsiveness to activist comments varies in predictable ways across agencies, but I find no evidence that the total number of comments affects rules. My experimental cases are not included in this prospectus. They will be rules selected by organizations that have agreed to randomly assign specific targets of their mass comment campaigns. While these few cases will not provide the necessary power for statistical tests, the responses of the public, elected officials, and rulewriters may help illuminate causal mechanisms.

<li id="fn1"><p>As I show elsewhere <span class="citation">(Judge-Lord <a href="#ref-Judge-Lord2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, most comments submitted to
regulations.gov are form comments, more akin to petition signatures
than sophisticated lobbying. Indeed, approximately 40 million out of
50 million (80%) of these public comments mobilized by just 100
advocacy organizations.<a href="index.html#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>In 2018, the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS)
identified mass commenting as a top issue in administrative law. In
their report to ACUS, <span class="citation">Sant’Ambrogio and Staszewski (<a href="#ref-SantAmbrogio2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> conclude, “The ‘mass
comments’ occasionally submitted in great volume in highly salient
rulemakings are one of the more vexing challenges facing agencies in
recent years. Mass comments are typically the result of orchestrated
campaigns by advocacy groups to persuade members or other
like-minded individuals to express support for or opposition to an
agency’s proposed rule.” Mass comment campaigns are known to drive
significant participation of ordinary people in Environmental
Protection Agency rulemaking

examines public input on three rules, finds that ordinary people
made up the majority of commenters demonstrating “demand among the
mass public for a seat at the table in the regulatory process.”<a href="index.html#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
