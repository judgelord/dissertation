Astroturf: Interest Group Lobbying and Corporate Strategy
Thomas P. Lyon  John W. Maxwell

- in which the firm covertly subsidizes a group with similar views to lobby when it normally would not;
Lloyd Bentsen, a long‐time senator from Texas, describes the artificial grassroots campaigns created by public relations (PR) firms (Stauber and Rampton, 1995, p. 79)
For example, Lupia and McCubbins (1994) and de Figueiredo et al. (1999) study how administrative procedures can be designed to optimize the flow of information to politicians, and Baron (2001) develops a model in which activists attempt to influence corporate strategy via the threat of consumer boycotts. Kollman (1998) studies the motivations and strategy behind lobbying behavior based on detailed interviews with 90 interest group leaders. Grossman and Helpman (2001) provide an excellent introduction to the recent theoretical literature on interest group politics.

Astroturf, quite simply, is synthetic grassroots organizing created for manipulative political purposes (see Lyon &
Maxwell, 2004; Allen, 1998; Austin, 2002). In this type of activity, an entity that wishes to affect public policy creates an effort
that gives the appearance of grassroots support

 “Comments received were overwhelmingly in favor of maintaining existing monuments.” Sounds like something you might pay attention to, right? Not necessarily—Zinke goes on to dismiss those millions of comments because their very number and unanimity “demonstrated a well-orchestrated national campaign organized by multiple organizations.” Said organizations included REI, hunting and fishing groups, and of course the Sierra Club and other conservation groups. In Trumpworld, the fact that opposition is organized marks it as illegitimate; to an autocratic administration, public opinion is of no interest. https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/zinke-doesn-t-care-what-you-think
 
 The Center for Western Priorities analyzed a random sample (n=1000) of the 654,197 comments posted as of Monday morning. 98 percent of those comments expressed support for keeping or expanding national monument designations.* Just one percent requested President Trump attempt to shrink or erase monument boundaries.

 “Comments received were overwhelmingly in favor of maintaining existing monuments and demonstrated a well-orchestrated national campaign organized by multiple organizations,” Zinke said in the statement on Thursday. He acknowledged supporters’ point that monuments can bring economic benefits to local communities.
